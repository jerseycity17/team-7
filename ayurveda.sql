In ancient India, ghee was the preferred cooking oil. In the last several decades, ghee has been implicated in the increased prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Asian Indians due to its content of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol and, in heated ghee, cholesterol oxidation products. Our previous research on Sprague-Dawley outbred rats, which serve as a model for the general population, showed no effect of 5 and 10% ghee-supplemented diets on serum cholesterol and triglycerides. However, in Fischer inbred rats, which serve as a model for genetic predisposition to diseases, results of our previous research showed an increase in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels when fed a 10% ghee-supplemented diet. In the present study, we investigated the effect of 10% dietary ghee on microsomal lipid peroxidation, as well as serum lipid levels in Fischer inbred rats to assess the effect of ghee on free radical mediated processes that are implicated in many chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease. Results showed that 10% dietary ghee fed for 4 weeks did not have any significant effect on levels of serum total cholesterol, but did increase triglyceride levels in Fischer inbred rats. Ghee at a level of 10% in the diet did not increase liver microsomal lipid peroxidation or liver microsomal lipid peroxide levels. Animal studies have demonstrated many beneficial effects of ghee, including dose-dependent decreases in serum total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and triglycerides; decreased liver total cholesterol, triglycerides, and cholesterol esters; and a lower level of nonenzymatic-induced lipid peroxidation in liver homogenate. Similar results were seen with heated (oxidized) ghee which contains cholesterol oxidation products. A preliminary clinical study showed that high doses of medicated ghee decreased serum cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters in psoriasis patients. A study on a rural population in India revealed a significantly lower prevalence of coronary heart disease in men who consumed higher amounts of ghee. Research on Maharishi Amrit Kalash-4 (MAK-4), an Ayurvedic herbal mixture containing ghee, showed no effect on levels of serum cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), LDL, or triglycerides in hyperlipidemic patients who ingested MAK-4 for 18 weeks. MAK-4 inhibited the oxidation of LDL in these patients. The data available in the literature do not support a conclusion of harmful effects of the moderate consumption of ghee in the general population. Factors that may be involved in the rise of CAD in Asian Indians include the increased use of vanaspati (vegetable ghee) which contains 40% trans fatty acids, psychosocial stress, insulin resistance, and altered dietary patterns. Research findings in the literature support the beneficial effects of ghee outlined in the ancient Ayurvedic texts and the therapeutic use of ghee for thousands of years in the Ayurvedic system of medicine.','Apr-10','12/15/2014 3:03','12/15/2014 3:03','134-140','2','31','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22131700','','');

But its usefulness is limited by its toxicity to normal tissues, including cells of the kidney proximal tubule. The purpose of the present study is to investigate whether the hydro-alcoholic extract of Rubia cordifolia could decrease the intensity of toxicity in Swiss albino mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cisplatin at a dose of 12 mg/kg body wt was administered intraperitoneally to Swiss albino mice. Another set of animals was given hydro-alcoholic extract of Rubia cordifolia at different doses along with cisplatin treatment. The antioxidant levels, serum creatinine, serum urea etc. were analyzed. RESULTS: The extract could significantly decrease the cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity as inferred from the tissue antioxidant status in the drug administered animals. Remarkable change was observed in serum creatinine and urea levels. Lipid peroxidation in the kidney and liver tissues was also considerably reduced in Rubia cordifolia extract treated animals. CONCLUSION: Hydro-alcoholic extracts of Rubia cordifolia are effective in reducing the renal damage caused by the cancer chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. Since Rubia cordifolia has been in use as an important ingredient in the traditional Ayurvedic system of medicine, it could be safe and beneficial to use this herbal extract as an adjuvant to ameliorate renal damage in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy with cisplatin.','2008 Jul-Sep','12/15/2014 17:55','12/15/2014 17:55','111-115','3','4','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18923202','','Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Catalase; Cisplatin; Glutathione; Kidney Diseases; Lipid Peroxidation; Male; Mice; Neoplasms; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Rubia; Superoxide Dismutase');

This article discusses the evidence for a number of these interventions which mothers may find more acceptable than orthodox treatment. The aim of this article is to highlight the possible role of a number of complementary and alternative medicines as adjuncts or alternative treatments for postnatal depression. The interventions discussed in this article include Ayurvedic medicine, herbalism, homeopathy, aromatherapy, massage, hypnosis and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). With the exception of TCM and Ayurvedic medicine, these interventions have been supported by the House of Lord\'s Select Committee on Science and Technology (2000) as having an evidence base. Ayurvedic medicine and TCM have been included in this article however, because a number of clients may be using them as their main system of health care--thereby validating the need for information regarding their efficacy. This article is not exhaustive, nor a licence to practice, but is intended as a resource for practitioners with a sound understanding of postnatal depression and conventional treatments whose clients may reject these approaches and be looking for alternative interventions. The final choice of treatment should be the result of discussion between the health visitor and the client and will depend on considerations such as availability, cost and acceptability of the intervention--this article does not, therefore, suggest a \'best option\' approach. In addition, it does not address the professional and legal responsibilities of practitioners since these have been well reviewed by Darley (1995), Mantle (1997), Knape (1998) and Rankin-Box (2001).','Nov-02','12/15/2014 18:22','12/15/2014 18:22','197-203','4','8','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12463609','','Aromatherapy; Attitude to Health; Complementary Therapies; Depression, Postpartum; Exercise Therapy; Female; Homeopathy; Humans; Hypnosis; Massage; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mothers; Music Therapy; Phytotherapy; Role');

In addition, these treatments are often toxic and expensive, thus new agents which are safe, affordable and effective are urgently needed. We describe here the results of our study with acetyl-11-keto-Î²-boswellic acid (AKBA), an agent obtained from an Ayurvedic medicine, gum resin of Boswellia serrata. Whether AKBA has an activity against human PaCa, was examined in in vitro models and in an orthotopic nude mouse model of PaCa. We found that AKBA inhibited the proliferation of four different PaCa cell lines (AsPC-1, PANC-28, and MIA PaCa-2 with K-Ras and p53 mutations, and BxPC-3 with wild-type K-Ras and p53 mutation). These effects correlated with an inhibition of constitutively active NF-ÎºB and suppression of NF-ÎºB regulating gene expression. AKBA also induced apoptosis, and sensitized the cells to apoptotic effects of gemcitabine. In the orthotopic nude mouse model of PaCa, p.o. administration of AKBA alone (100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the tumor growth; this activity was enhanced by gemcitabine. In addition, AKBA inhibited the metastasis of the PaCa to spleen, liver, and lungs. This correlated with decreases in Ki-67, a biomarker of proliferation, and CD31, a biomarker of microvessel density, in the tumor tissue. AKBA produced significant decreases in the expression of NF-ÎºB regulating genes in the tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis also showed AKBA downregulated the expression of COX-2, MMP-9, CXCR4, and VEGF in the tissues. Overall these results demonstrate that AKBA can suppress the growth and metastasis of human pancreatic tumors in an orthotopic nude mouse model that correlates with modulation of multiple targets.','2011','12/15/2014 2:38','12/15/2014 2:38','e26943','10','6','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22066019','','Animals; Antigens, CD31; Apoptosis; Cell Proliferation; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Deoxycytidine; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Ki-67 Antigen; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neovascularization, Pathologic; NF-kappa B; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Triterpenes; Tumor Markers, Biological; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays');

These observations indicate that Ayurveda may attach more importance to pharmacological properties of raw drugs than to their botanical classification. Further research into the nature of raw drugs named could open up new areas of medicinal plant classification, linking chemistry and bioactivity.

RESULTS: Eighteen samples of Ayurvedic preparations were obtained from 15 subjects and analyzed for lead content. Five adult subjects with established lead poisoning received chelation therapy. In Ayurvedic preparations a wide range of lead content was found (0.9-72,990 micrograms Pb/g; 0.35-29,900 micrograms Pb/capsule or tablet). The blood lead, erythrocyte delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and erythrocyte protoporphyrin of the subjects, grouped according to the remedies used, correlated with the lead content in the preparations (p < 0.001). Chelation therapy was successful in normalization of laboratory findings and clinical recovery. CONCLUSION: Ayurvedic metal-mineral tonics are again identified as a potential source of high lead.

However, the chief aim of current drug discovery approaches is to search for single-entity drugs that interact with well-defined molecular targets (a single receptor or enzyme). The concept of multi-target drugs or multi-component therapy is gaining increased attention with the discovery that many diseases (like hypertension) are best treated by multi-drug or multi-target therapies. Traditional medicines, such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Indian Ayurveda, have been re-evaluated and are becoming important resources for the discovery of bioactive molecules with therapeutic effects and for designing multi-targets drugs. This article provides an overview of new strategies and techniques to design therapeutic regimes that comprise more than one active ingredient to produce synergistic effects by simultaneously interacting with multiple molecular targets. Advances in phytochemistry, high throughput screening, DNA sequencing, systems biology, and bioinformatics can reveal the chemical composition and molecular mechanisms of TCM and together provide a new template for the early stages of drug discovery.

The potential of using medicinal herbs as cancer chemopreventive nutraceuticals and functional food is promising. Thus, there is a need for exploring drugs/agents which act as chemopreventive agents. Phyllanthus niruri is a well known medicinal plant which has been used in Ayurvedic medicine as hepatoprotective, antiviral, antibacterial, analgesic, antispasmodic and antidiabetic. The present study was carried out to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of a hydro-alcoholic extract of the whole plant, in 7-9 week old male Swiss albino mice, on the two stage process of skin carcinogenesis induced by a single topical application of 7, 12-dimethylbenz (a)anthracene (100 microg/100 microl acetone) and two weeks later promoted by repeated application of croton oil (1% in acetone/three times a week) till the end of experiment (16 weeks). The oral administration of P. niruri at a dose of 1000 mg/kg/b.wt. at peri- (i.e. 7 days before and 7 days after DMBA application) and post- (i.e. starting from the croton oil application) initiational phase of papillomagenesis caused significant reduction in tumor incidence, tumor yield, tumor burden and cumulative number of papillomas as compared to carcinogen-treated controls.

MATERIAL: In a randomized open-label study, we investigated 40 healthy participants aged 30 - 60 years, physically active, with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 - 45. The participants were randomly allocated into two groups. Body weight, BMI, and body composition were measured. Both groups (A and B) received a guideline for lifestyle and fitness training for 4 weeks. Group B additionally took one capsule containing 200 mg of Salacia reticulata and 1.6 Âµg (i. e. 64 IU) Vitamin Dâ‚ƒ (SRD) 3 times/day with the meals. RESULTS: Significant weight and body-fat reduction within 4 weeks was observed. Group A lost 1.8 kg or 2.1 %, group B lost 5.3 kg or 6.1 % (p = 0.03), therefore BMI reduction was achieved. While Group A lost 1.4 % of body fat, group B reduced it by 4.5 % (p = 0.01).

The present work has for the first time tried to elucidate the anti-inflammatory potential of aqueous extract of Tectaria cicutaria rhizome (TCRaq) in vitro as well as in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-inflammatory potential of TCRaq was analyzed in vivo in carrageenan induced rat paw edema model. Serum antioxidant status in TCRaq-treated as well as untreated control rodents was measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. In vitro experiments for analyzing the anti-inflammatory potential of TCRaq were performed on murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Analysis of nitric oxide release in RAW 264.7 cells was done by Griess reaction. RT-PCR and western blotting experiment was performed to analyze the expression of iNOS. Expression of COX-2 and NFÎºB proteins was evaluated by western blotting. RESULTS: TCRaq significantly reduced the paw volume in Sprague-Dawley rats at a dose of 200mg/kg body weight, which was comparable with the standard diclofenac treatment. The rats treated with TCRaq showed a significant increase in the serum antioxidant levels compared to the untreated control animals. TCRaq was able to reduce the nitric oxide (NO) levels in RAW 264.7 cells that had been stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in iNOS expression at mRNA and protein level. Interestingly, TCRaq was found to decrease the expression of COX-2 as well as the nuclear translocation of NFÎºB in RAW 264.7 cells.

Kanakasava (KNK) is a polyherbal ayurvedic preparation used since ancient times for the treatment of respiratory diseases and to improve immunity. OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the immunostimulating potential of KNK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The immunostimulating activity of KNK was evaluated by measuring immunoglobulin M (IgM) production and splenocyte proliferation in vitro. BALB/c mice splenocytes were treated with 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4% (v/v) of KNK, and the cells were subcultured at 37Â°C, humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO(2) for 120 h. The production of IgM in cultured supernatants were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the proliferations of cells were measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y)-2,5-diphenylterazolium bromide (MTT) method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: KNK at the doses of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 1.5% (v/v) significantly augmented polyclonal IgM production (1.211, 1.260, 1.274, 1.180, and 1.028 Âµg/mL, respectively) compared to control (0.246 Âµg/mL). Similarly, the same doses stimulated the proliferation of splenocytes as well (Abs. 0.270, 0.281, 0.368, 0.328, and 0.301, respectively, measured at 570 nm) compared to untreated cells (Abs. 0.137). The activity of KNK was not retarded by the treatment of cells with polymixin B. Thus, our results demonstrate that KNK possesses immunostimulating potential that acts through the induction of lymphocytes for proliferation and IgM production. CONCLUSION: KNK may be useful for strengthening immune responses in case of insufficient or impaired immunity.','Nov-12','12/14/2014 19:27','12/14/2014 19:27','1467-1472','11','50','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22849578','','Adjuvants, Immunologic; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Immunoglobulin M; Lymphocytes; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Plant Extracts; Polymyxin B; Spleen');

One of the possible approach to overcome these drawbacks is to represent them in unit dosage form i.e. tablet dosage form. The purpose of this study is to elucidate and quantify the compressibility and compactibility of herbal granules prepared by using hydrogel isolated from whole seeds of Ocimum basilicum as a novel binder. The compressibility is the ability of the powder to deform under pressure and the compactibility is the ability of a powder to form coherent compacts. To test the functionality of novel excipients, Sonnergaard proved a simple linear model to confirm compactability, which is an uncomplicated tool for quantification. The tablets were compressed at increasing compression pressures and were evaluated for various mechanical properties. The linear relationship between specific crushing strength and compression pressure revealed the compactibility of the herbal granules and the linear relationship between porosity and logarithm of compression pressure revealed the compressible nature of the herbal granules according to the model developed by Sonnergaard. Thus the hydrogel isolated from whole seeds of Ocimum basillicum had potential as a granulating and binding agent.','May-09','12/15/2014 3:03','12/15/2014 3:03','320-322','3','71','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20490304','','');

Currently, the treatment regimens for hypoxia are aimed only at ameliorating the damage without complete cure. The need, therefore, for novel therapeutic drugs to treat HI continues. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the protective effects of the ethanol extract of Cyperus rotundus L. (Cyperaceae) (EECR), a medicinal plant used in Ayurvedic traditional medicine against sodium nitrite-induced hypoxia in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have evaluated the protective effect of 200 and 400â€‰mg/kg of EECR against sodium nitrite-induced hypoxia injury in rats by assessing the cognitive functions, motor, and behavioral effects of EECR treatment along with the histological changes in the brain. By comparing the protective effects of standard drugs galantamine, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor and pyritinol, an antioxidant nootropic drug against sodium nitrite-induced hypoxia in rats, we have tested the protective ability of EECR. RESULTS: EECR at doses of 200 and 400â€‰mg/kg was able to protect against the cognitive impairments, and the locomotor activity and muscular coordination defects, which are affected by sodium nitrite-induced hypoxia injury in rats. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, we suggest that the medicinal herb C. rotundus possesses a protective effect against sodium nitrite-induced hypoxia in rats.

Results obtained from the in vitro experiments were then verified by examining the effect of PME on glucose clearance in normoglycemic, non-diabetic sheep in vivo. RESULTS: Exposure of mouse pancreatic and muscle tissues to PME stimulated the insulin secretion and glucose uptake, respectively, in a concentration-dependent manner. PME-mediated muscle glucose uptake was not potentiated in the presence of insulin indicating that PME acts via pathways which are utilized by insulin. Bio-assay-guided fractionation of PME yielded a high molecular weight fraction which had potent antidiabetic properties in vitro, and in in vivo.

In the present work, attempt has been made to find out plant sources which show anti hyperglycaemic activity (AhG) (i.e. compounds that bring down the blood glucose level in the body). Ayurvedic plants showing AhG activity formed the basis of our study by using the platform of Computer Aided Drug Designing (CADD). Among 600 plants showing AhG activity, 500 compounds were selected and screened, out of which 243 compounds showed drug likeness property that can be used as therapeutic ligand/drug. Initial screening of such compounds was done based on their drug likeness or biochemical properties. Dynamic interaction of these molecules was captured through Protein-Ligand study. It also gave an insight of the binding pockets involved. Bench marking of all the parameters were done using the diabetic inhibitor drug, Glipizide.

METHODS: 81 drug naive patients diagnosed as Vishada by ayurvedic physician and MDD according to DSM IV-TR were given ayurvedic Virechana module (therapeutic purgation) and were randomized into two groups. Patients in group A (n=41) received Ayushman-15A while group B (n=40) received Ayushman-15B for two months and Shirodhara (forehead-oil pouring therapy). Patients were assessed with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were estimated at baseline and after ayurvedic therapy. HRV and endocrinal parameters were compared with age and gender matched healthy volunteers. RESULTS: HRV parameters showed significant sympathetic dominance in patients compared to healthy volunteers. Two months of ayurvedic treatment significantly decreased psychopathology, showed increase in vagal tone, decrease in sympathetic tone and reduced cortisol levels.

In Hindu and Ayurvedic medicine, and among human cultures of the Indian subcontinent in general, the perception of the food-medicine continuum is especially well established. The preparation of the exhilarating, gold-coloured Soma, Amrita or Ambrosia, the elixir and food of the \'immortals\'-the Hindu pantheon-by the ancient Indo-Aryans, is described in the Rigveda in poetic hymns. Different theories regarding the botanical identity of Soma circulate, but no pharmacologically and historically convincing theory exists to date. We intend to contribute to the botanical, chemical and pharmacological characterisation of Soma through an analysis of two historical Amrita recipes recorded in the Bower Manuscript. The recipes are referred therein as panaceas (clarified butter) and also as a medicine to treat nervous diseases (oil), while no exhilarating properties are mentioned. Notwithstanding this, we hypothesise, that these recipes are related to the ca. 1800 years older Rigvedic Soma. We suppose that the psychoactive Soma ingredient(s) are among the components, possibly in smaller proportions, of the Amrita recipes preserved in the Bower Manuscript. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Bower Manuscript is a medical treatise recorded in the 6th century A.D. in Sanskrit on birch bark leaves, probably by Buddhist monks, and unearthed towards the end of the 19th century in Chinese Turkestan. We analysed two Amrita recipes from the Bower Manuscript, which was translated by Rudolf Hoernle into English during the early 20th century. A database search with the updated Latin binomials of the herbal ingredients was used to gather quantitative phytochemical and pharmacological information. RESULTS: Together, both Amrita recipes contain around 100 herbal ingredients. Psychoactive alkaloid containing species still important in Ayurvedic, Chinese and Thai medicine and mentioned in the recipe for \'Amrita-PrÃ¢sa clarified butter\' and \'Amrita Oil\' are: Tinospora cordifolia (Amrita, Guduchi), three Sida spp., Mucuna pruriens, Nelumbo nucifera, Desmodium gangeticum, and Tabernaemontana divaricata. These species contain several notorious and potential psychoactive and psychedelic alkaloids, namely: tryptamines, 2-phenylethylamine, ephedrine, aporphines, ibogaine, and L-DOPA. Furthermore, protoberberine alkaloids, tetrahydro-Î²-carbolines, and tetrahydroisoquinolines with monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I) activity but also neurotoxic properties are reported. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that Soma was a combination of a protoberberine alkaloids containing Tinospora cordifolia juice with MAO-I properties mixed together with a tryptamine rich Desmodium gangeticum extract or a blending of Tinospora cordifolia with an ephedrine and phenylethylamine-rich Sida spp. extract. Tinospora cordifolia combined with Desmodium gangeticum might provide a psychedelic experience with visual effects, while a combination of Tinospora cordifolia with Sida spp. might lead to more euphoric and amphetamine-like experiences.','8-Aug-14','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','373-386','1','155','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24907429','','');

The effects on the forced swimming test were assessed along with the levels of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleaceticacid (5-HIAA) in striatum, frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and brain stem after 21 days of chronic oral administration of the extract (500 and 1500 mg/kg-body weight). The extract significantly increased climbing behavior at 500 mg/kg and increased swimming behavior by reducing immobility time at 1500 mg/kg when compared with the control group in forced swimming test (P<0.05). This showed that the active substances present in 50% ethanol extract of the ayurvedic preparation possess antidepressant activity and their specificity towards particular behavior, depends on the concentration of the extract. Further it showed that the enhancement of active behavior in FST is not due to generalized motor activity. The neurochemical estimations revealed the swim stressor inducing alterations in the levels of DA, 5-HT and their metabolites HVA and 5-HIAA in the brain regions assayed as compared with the non-stressed control rats.

This paper proposes independent scientific evidence for the proposed identification of the doshas and for the systems analysis on which it is based. In particular, it points to coenzyme A, a key component of fatty acid metabolism. Its universal presence in all cells implies that it is an evolutionary invariant ant that the biochemical pathway on which it lies must be exceptionally significant. The systems analysis shows that the pathway connects the cellular functions of energy turnover and energy storage, fundamental to the overall strategy of cell regulation. This, combined with the requirement for the pathway\'s close regulation, makes it effectively impossible to replace coenzyme A by a combination of simultaneous mutations or sequence of mutations and it should indeed remain invariant during evolution. The universality of coenzyme A is therefore consistent with its identified role, and supports the systems analysis identifying the doshas. Their systems functions survive developmental transformations of evolution with recognizable continuity. By virtue of that, vata, pitta, and kapha can be identified with them in all species.','Jun-05','12/15/2014 18:09','12/15/2014 18:09','385-390','3','11','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15992219','','Coenzyme A; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Models, Biological');

Decisions within the Government of India have led to a conducive environment for conducting clinical studies, to achieve integration of more than one system of medicine, so that their combined benefits can be brought to bear on chronic, difficult-to-treat conditions. AIM: To develop integrative dermatology treatment protocols for patients with long-standing skin diseases who have received treatment from many centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A team of doctors from modern dermatology, Ayurveda, yoga therapy, and homeopathy studied recruited patients to develop mutual orientation on each therapeutic system and a working knowledge of approach to their clinical diagnosis. Six-hundred thirty-eight patients affected by lower limb lymphedema requiring skin care as a major part of treatment were treated integrating modern dermatology and Ayurveda. Three-hundred eighty-one vitiligo patients were examined and treated to understand the clinical presentations and treatment options in Ayurveda. RESULTS: A two-step cluster analysis performed by SPSS Version 16 showed average volume reductions of 13.3% and 23% on day 14, 19.7% and 31.1% on day 45, and 23.4% and 39.7% on day 90 of treatment in small and large lymphedematous limbs. Inflammatory episodes before the onset on this treatment was reported by 79.5% of our lymphedema patients, and 9.4% reported this at the end of three months after our treatment. Among vitiligo patients, we found that 39.6% of patients had kapha, 39.8% pitta, 10.8% had vatha and 0.52% has tridoshaja presentation. There are over 100 treatment options available in Ayurveda to treat vitiligo. DISCUSSION: Each system of medicine recognizes the same disease albeit with minor difference in description. Skin care procedures like washing and emollients restore the barrier function and skin health. We have converged Ayurvedic skin care with that of dermatology with an aim of achieving patient management that is better than that achievable by a single system alone. Overload of the lymphatic system due to loss of epidermal barrier function and consequent inflammation from bacteria and soil irritants is responsive to selected Ayurvedic herbal preparations. CONCLUSION: It is evident that integration at the therapeutic level is possible, although the pathological basis is interpreted differently. Irrespective of background understanding of the given disease, a mutually oriented multisystem therapeutic team was able to effectively use medicines from more than one system of medicine and to develop guidelines for their prescription and a patient care algorithm.','Mar-11','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','310-334','3','50','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21342165','','Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Dermatology; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; India; Lymphedema; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Patient-Centered Care; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Vitiligo; Yoga');

(Compositae) are employed in Ayurvedic system of medicine as \"Vajikaran Rasayana\"--a category of drugs for vitality and virility. They are believed to have aphrodisiac action. The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate their effects on sexual behavior in male rats. METHODS: Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into control group, testosterone group, low-dose (50 mg/kg) petroleum ether extract (PEE) group and high-dose (100 mg/kg) PEE group. PEE obtained from the roots of Anacyclus pyrethrum was administered orally to albino rats once daily, and 0.5 mg/kg (body weight) of testosterone was given intramuscularly twice weekly and served as positive control. The course of treatment was 28 days. The effects of PEE and testosterone on changes in body and accessory sexual organ weights, sexual behavior, penile erection and sexual performance were studied before treatment, after 15 and 28 days of treatment and 7 and 15 days after treatment. RESULTS: After 28 days of treatment, PEE and testosterone had a marked influence on body and accessory sexual organ weights as compared with arachis oil. The treated male rats were more receptive and oriented towards female rats and increased precopulatory activities like licking and sniffing of female anogenital were observed. The penile erection index was significantly increased with reduction in mount latency and intromission latency period. There were four-fold increase in mount and three-fold increase in intromission frequency in treated rats reflecting improved sexual performance. The behavioral and sexual parameters were also observed after a lapse of 7 and 15 days of discontinuance of drug treatment. CONCLUSION: Unlike testosterone, the PEE of Anacyclus pyrethrum shows efficacy in rats tested after the lapse of 7 and 15 days of discontinuation of treatment. This suggests that the drug has prolonged effect and capacitate the treated rats for improved sexual potential.','Aug-10','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','767-773','8','8','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727332','','Animals; Aphrodisiacs; Asteraceae; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Penile Erection; Petroleum; Plant Extracts; Plant Roots; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Sexual Behavior, Animal');

The present graduate level curriculum lists out the topics from \'contemporary medical science\' and \'Ayurveda\' discretely, placing no emphasis on integration. Most of the textbooks, too, follow the same pattern. This makes learning not only difficult, but also leads to cognitive dissonance. OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a few integrative teaching methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduced three different interventions in the subject Kriya Sharira with special reference to \'cardiovascular physiology\'. The instructional methods that we evaluated were: 1. Integrative module on cardiovascular physiology (IMCP), 2. case-stimulated learning (CSL), and 3. classroom small group discussion (CSGD). In the first two experiments, we subjected the experimental group of graduate students to the integrative instructional methods. The control group of students received the instructions in a conventional, didactic, teacher-centric way. After the experiments were over, the learning outcome was assessed and compared on the basis of the test scores. The groups were crossed over thereafter and the instructional methods were interchanged. Finally, feedback was obtained on different questionnaires. In the third experiment, only student feedback was taken as we could not have a control group. RESULTS: The test results in the first experiment showed that the integrative method is comparable with the conventional method. In the second experiment, the test results showed that the integrative method is better than the conventional method. The student feedback showed that all the three methods were perceived to be more interesting than the conventional one. CONCLUSION: The study shows that the development of testable integrative teaching methods is possible in the context of Ayurveda education. It also shows that students find integrative approaches more interesting than the conventional method.','Jul-13','12/14/2014 18:55','12/14/2014 18:55','138-146','3','4','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24250142','','');

Arjunolic acid is one such novel phytomedicine with multifunctional therapeutic applications. It is a triterpenoid saponin, isolated earlier from Terminalia arjuna and later from Combretum nelsonii, Leandra chaeton etc. Arjunolic acid is a potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger. The scientific basis for the use of arjunolic acid as cardiotonic in Ayurvedic medicine is proven by its vibrant functions such as prevention of myocardial necrosis, platelet aggregation and coagulation and lowering of blood pressure, heart rate and cholesterol levels. Its antioxidant property combined with metal chelating property protects organs from metal and drug induced toxicity. It also plays an effective role in exerting protection against both type I and type II diabetes and also ameliorates diabetic renal dysfunctions. Its therapeutic multifunctionality is shown by its wound healing, antimutagenic and antimicrobial activity. The mechanism of cytoprotection conferred by arjunolic acid can be explained by its property to reduce the oxidative stress by enhancing the antioxidant levels. Apart from its pathophysiological functions, it possesses dynamic insecticidal property and it is used as a structural molecular framework in supramolecular chemistry and nanoscience. Esters of ajunolic acid function as gelators of a wide variety of organic liquids. Experimental studies demonstrate the versatile effects of arjunolic acid, but still, further investigations are necessary to identify the functional groups responsible for its multivarious effects and to study the molecular mechanisms as well as the probable side effects/toxicity owing to its long-term use. Though the beneficial role of this triterpenoid has been assessed from various angles, a comprehensive review of its effects on biochemistry and organ pathophysiology is lacking and this forms the rationale of this review.','Mar-10','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','238-247','3','48','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21046976','','Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antineoplastic Agents; Cardiotonic Agents; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Molecular Structure; Plant Extracts; Triterpenes');

This phenolic acid has been reported to possess various pharmacological properties of which its antioxidant activity is a prime one. Therefore it is rational to hypothesize that it may ameliorate myelosuppression and oxidative stress induced by cyclophosphamide, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent. Commercial cyclophosphamide, Endoxan, was administered intraperitoneally to Swiss albino mice (50mg/kg) pretreated with 15, 30 and 60mg/kg doses of cinnamic acid orally at alternate days for 15days. Cinnamic acid pre-treatment was found to reduce cyclophosphamide induced hypocellularity in the bone marrow and spleen. This recovery was also reflected in the peripheral blood count. Amelioration of hypocellularity could be correlated with the modulation of cell cycle phase distribution. Cinnamic acid pre-treatment reduced bone marrow and hepatic oxidative stress as evident by lipid peroxidation and activity assays of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione-S-transferase. The present study indicates that cinnamic acid pretreatment has protective influence on the myelosuppression and oxidative stress induced by cyclophosphamide. This investigation is an attempt and is the first of its kind to establish cinnamic acid as an agent whose consumption provides protection to normal cells from the toxic effects of a widely used anti-cancer drug.','5-Feb-12','12/15/2014 2:38','12/15/2014 2:38','231-239','3','195','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22285266','','Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating; Blood Cell Count; Bone Marrow; Catalase; Cell Cycle; Cinnamates; Cyclophosphamide; Flow Cytometry; Glutathione Transferase; Mice; Oxidative Stress; Random Allocation; Spleen; Superoxide Dismutase; Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances');

(Combretaceae) is a medium-sized tree that grows in the wild throughout India. T. chebula has been extensively used in Ayurveda, Unani, and homoeopathic medicine. The fruit has been used as a traditional medicine for a household remedy against various human ailments. Traditionally T. chebula is used to cure chronic ulcer, gastritis, and stomach cancers. OBJECTIVE: The present study is to evaluate the antiulcer effect of hydroalcoholic (70%) extract of Terminalia chebula fruit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aspirin, ethanol and cold restraint stress-induced ulcer methods in rats were used for the study. The effects of the extract on gastric secretions, pH, total and free acidity using pylorus ligated methods were also evaluated. RESULTS: Animals pretreated with doses of 200 and 500â€‰mg/kg hydroalcoholic extract showed significant reduction in lesion index, total affected area and percentage of lesion in comparison with control group (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 and Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) in the aspirin, ethanol and cold restraint stress-induced ulcer models. Similarly extracts increased mucus production in aspirin and ethanol-induced ulcer models. At doses of 200 and 500â€‰mg/kg of T. chebula extract showed antisecretory activity in pylorus ligated model, which lead to a reduction in the gastric juice volume, free acidity, total acidity, and significantly increased gastric pH.

To indicate its toxic potential, Ashtamahadoshas (eight major ill effects) have been quoted in classics and due emphasis have been given to its Shodhana procedure. In the present study, Tamra bhasma prepared from Shodhita and Ashodhita Tamra was subjected to oral toxicity study to ascertain the role of Shodhana process on safety profile of Tamra bhasma on subchronic administration to albino rats. Both the samples were administered to rats for 45 consecutive days at the doses of 5.5, 27.5, and 55 mg/kg. Animals were sacrificed on 46(th) day and parameters like hematological, serum biochemical, and histopathology of various organs were studied. Results showed that Tamra bhasma prepared from Ashodhita Tamra has pathological implications on different hematological, serum biochemical and cytoarchitecture of different organs even at therapeutic dose level (5.5 mg/kg). Whereas, Tamra bhasma prepared from Shodhita Tamra is safe even at five-fold to therapeutic equivalent doses (27.5 mg/kg).

The key to health is for these factors to maintain stability since disease is seen as a perturbation in this network. Ayurvedic treatment aims not only at removal of disease, but also at the restoration of the equilibrium of bodily functions. The centuries-old science of Ayurveda, apart from being a holistic form of medicine, also clearly defines the student-teacher and doctor-patient relationship. It sets high ethical standards of professional and personal integrity for the doctor, teacher and student.

The present work was aimed to study the effect of concomitant administration of Trikatu on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diclofenac sodium, a frequently prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, having a poor oral bioavailability (54 +/- 2%). The effect of Trikatu on the bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium was studied in rabbits. It was observed that Trikatu significantly decreased the serum levels of diclofenac sodium. The pharmacodynamic study was carried out to evaluate the effect of Trikatu on the anti-inflammatory activity of diclofenac sodium using carragenin-induced rat paw edema model. It was observed that the mean percent edema inhibition shown by the combination of Trikatu and diclofenac was similar to that shown by Trikatu alone but significantly less than that shown by diclofenac alone. Thus, the experimental findings indicated that Trikatu pretreatment might decrease the bioavailability of certain drugs probably through a drug-herb interaction thereby adversely affecting the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs.','Apr-04','12/15/2014 18:22','12/15/2014 18:22','277-280','3-Feb','91','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15120451','','Administration, Oral; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Biological Availability; Carrageenan; Diclofenac; Edema; Fruit; Ginger; Herb-Drug Interactions; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Phytotherapy; Piper; Plant Extracts; Rabbits; Rats; Rats, Wistar');

The protective effect of methanolic, ethanolic and water extracts of N. jatamansi (NJ-MEx, NJ-EEx and NJ-WEx respectively) was determined by MTT assay. NJ-MEx significantly protected against Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚ cytotoxicity when cells were pretreated for 24 h. The level of antioxidant enzymes, catalase, superoxide dismutase (Cu-ZnSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and a direct scavenger of free radicals, glutathione (GSH), significantly increased following pre-treatment with NJ-MEx. Lipid peroxidation (LPx) significantly decreased in NJ-MEx-pretreated cultures. The expression of a C6 differentiation marker, GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), stress markers HSP70 (heat shock protein) and mortalin (also called glucose regulated protein 75, Grp75) significantly decreased when cells were pre-treated with NJ-MEx before being subjected to Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚ treatment as shown by immunofluorescence, western blotting and RT-PCR results.

METHODS: Forty-three seropositive RA patients by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria with disease duration of less than 7 years were assigned to the following treatment groups: MTX plus Ayurvedic placebo (n = 14), Ayurveda plus MTX placebo (n = 12), or Ayurveda plus MTX (n = 17). Outcomes included the Disease Activity Score (DAS28-CRP), ACR20/50/70, and Health Assessment Questionnaire--Disability Index. All measures were obtained every 12 weeks for 36 weeks. Analyses included descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, Ï‡Â², or Student t test. The unique features of this study included the development of placebos for each Ayurvedic pharmacological dosage form and individualization of Ayurvedic therapy. RESULTS: All groups were comparable at baseline in demographics and disease characteristics. There were no statistically significant differences among the 3 groups on the efficacy measures. ACR20 results were MTX 86%, Ayurveda 100%, and combination 82%, and DAS28-CRP response were MTX -2.4, Ayurveda -1.7, and combination -2.4. Differences in adverse events among groups were also not statistically significant, although the MTX groups experienced more adverse event (MTX 174, Ayurveda 112, combination 176). No deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In this first-ever, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study comparing Ayurveda, MTX, and their combination, all 3 treatments were approximately equivalent in efficacy, within the limits of a pilot study. Adverse events were numerically fewer in the Ayurveda-only group. This study demonstrates that double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies are possible when testing individualized classic Ayurvedic versus allopathic treatment in ways acceptable to western standards and to Ayurvedic physicians.

However, animals of both the TE + irradiation and DDW + irradiation groups did not survive up to 30 days post-irradiation beyond 11 Gy irradiation. The LD50/30 was found to be 8.6 Gy for the DDW + irradiation group and 9.9 Gy for TE + irradiation group. The administration of triphala resulted in an increase in the radiation tolerance by 1.4 Gy, and the dose reduction factor was found to be 1.15. To understand the mechanism of action of triphala, the free radical scavenging activity of the drug was evaluated. Triphala was found to scavenge (.)OH, O(2) (.) 2,2\'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) diammonium salt (ABTS)(.+) and NO(.) radicals in a dose dependent manner.','Dec-04','12/15/2014 18:22','12/15/2014 18:22','971-978','6','10','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15673991','','Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Free Radical Scavengers; Gamma Rays; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mice; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Radiation Injuries, Experimental; Radiation-Protective Agents');

One of the ingredients most commonly found in Ayurvedic arthritis formulas is guggul, an oleoresin of the herb Commiphora mukul (CM). The authors have conducted both preclinical and clinical investigations of guggul for reduction of pain, stiffness, and improved function, and to determine tolerability in older patients with a diagnosis of OA of the knee. METHODS: The study was conducted using an outcome, quasi-experimental, model. Thirty male and female participants meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, with a score of 2 or more on the Kellegran-Lawrence scale for at least 1 knee, were admitted in the study. CM was administered in capsule form (500 mg concentrated exact delivered TID) along with food. The WOMAC Total Score was used as a primary outcome measure. VAS scales, 6-minute walk-test, and WOMAC subscales were used as outcome measures. RESULTS: At the end of treatment, there was a significant difference in the scores of the primary and secondary outcome measures. On the primary measure, WOMAC total score, participants were significantly improved (P < 0.0001) after taking the supplement for 1 month and continued to improve at the 2-month marker and follow-up. Secondary measures of pain in the VAS format demonstrated participant improvement; however, mood state, and current pain were not significantly different (P < 0.05) than baseline until the 2 month assessment (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall data indicate significant improvement for participants during the trial in both scales and objective measures used for assessment purposes. There were no side effects reported during the trial.

In addition, the effects of these compounds on the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), nerve growth factor (NGF), the intracellular signaling markers, p-ERK1/2, p-CREB, and p-NF-kB, and nitric oxide (NO) production were measured in the spleen by Western blot analysis. Both brahmi and deprenyl enhanced CAT activity, and p-TH, NGF, and p-NF-kB expression in the spleen. However, deprenyl alone was found to enhance the p-ERK1/2 and p-CREB expression in the spleen. The activities of SOD, CAT, and GPx in the thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes, heart, and brain areas (frontal cortex, medial basal hypothalamus, striatum, and hippocampus) were differentially altered by brahmi and deprenyl.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was aimed to explore in vitro and in vivo immunomodulatory activities of the iridoids fraction i.e. n-butanol fraction of methanol extract from Barleria prionitis aerial parts (IFBp). MATERIALS AND METHODS: IFBp was studied for in vitro [nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test and neutrophils candidacidal assay] and in vivo immunomodulatory activity on cellular and humoral immune responses to the antigenic challenge by sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) and by neutrophil adhesion test, phagocytic activity and cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression. The study comprised the preliminary phytochemical screening, HPTLC standardization and maximum tolerable dose determination of IFBp. RESULTS: IFBp (50, 100 and 200Î¼g/ml) significantly (Pâ‰¤0.01) increased the intracellular killing activity of stimulated neutrophils assayed by in vitro NBT reduction test and neutrophils candidacidal assay. Pretreatment of IFBp (100 and 200mg/kg; p.o.) evoked a significant increase in percent neutrophils and neutrophils adhesion to nylon fibres. Oral administration of IFBp augmented the humoral immune response to SRBCs, evidenced by increase in antibody titres and dose dependently potentiated the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction induced by SRBCs in mice. IFBp potentiated significantly (Pâ‰¤0.01) the macrophage phagocytic activity and ameliorated the red blood cells, total white blood cells and platelets count and haemoglobin concentration, and also restored the myelosuppressive effects induced by cyclophosphamide. The content (% w/w; meanÂ±SD, n=3) of main iridoids i.e. shanzhiside methyl ester and barlerin was found to be 21.55Â±2.40 and 10.03Â±1.69 in IFBp of BP, respectively.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the commonest inflammatory joint disease seen in clinical practice. No systematic study on the use of CAM by patients with RA is available from northern India. METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence and usage characteristics of CAM in Indian patients with RA using a questionnaire at a tertiary care centre in northern India. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients with RA included in the study, 39% reported current CAM use. As many as 84 respondents (82%) reported having tried CAM during the course of their disease. A total of 215 CAM courses were used, out of which 77 were being continued. Ayurveda was the commonest (28% courses) followed by homoeopathy (20%), yoga asana (17%) and pranayama (12%). Pain control was the primary reason for using CAM (69% of users). Most CAM therapies (78%) were started on the advice of friends and relatives. Discontinuation of CAM was attributed to lack of clinical benefit (78%) and adverse effects (10%). Of the patients using CAM, 87% did not reveal its use to their physicians, primarily because the physician did not enquire about it. CONCLUSION: Patients with RA frequently use CAM for pain control. These practices are often not revealed to the treating physician.

AIM: To develop standard quality parameters for the Keshamasi, Keshanjana and Keshamasi ointment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scalp hairs of male and females collected from saloons were converted to classical Masi Kalpana and mixed with cow ghee and petrolatum in the ratio of 1:5 to prepare the Keshanjana and Keshamasi ointment respectively. Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) were adopted and recorded accordingly. The raw material, furnished products and plain Goghrita were subjected for quality control parameters i.e., physico-chemical evaluation, anti-microbial study, particle size analysis, heavy metal analysis through inductive couple plasma spectroscopy with high performance thin layer liquid chromatography fingerprints. RESULTS: Rancidity was negative in all the samples, indicating that the physico-chemical parameters are in acceptable range. Lead and zinc were present in most of the samples; while all samples are were free from microbial contamination. CONCLUSION: As no standards are available to compare the results of the current study, the observations cannot be compared.

For comparison purpose, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin was used. Materials and methods: Arthritis was induced in Wistar albino rats by intradermal injection of complete Freund\'s adjuvant (0.1â€‰ml) into the foot pad of right hind paw. Triphala (100â€‰mg/kgâ€‰bâ€‰wt, i.p.) was administered from day 11 to 18 after the administration of complete Freund\'s adjuvant. The activities/levels of lysosomal enzymes, glycoproteins, antioxidant status, and lipid peroxidation were determined in the paw tissues of arthritic rats. In addition, the inflammatory mediators were also measured in both the serum and the paw tissue of arthritic rats. Results: The levels/activities of lipid peroxidation (âˆ¼41.5%), glycoproteins (hexose âˆ¼43.3%, hexosamine âˆ¼36.5%, and sialic acid âˆ¼33.7%), lysosomal enzymes (acid phosphatase âˆ¼52.4%, Î²-galactosidase âˆ¼22.9%, N-acetyl Î²-glucosaminidase âˆ¼22.1%, and cathepsin-D âˆ¼27.7%) were found to be decreased and the antioxidant status (SOD âˆ¼75.6%, CAT âˆ¼62.7%, GPx âˆ¼55.8%, GST âˆ¼82.1%, and GSH âˆ¼72.7%) was increased in the paw tissues of triphala-treated arthritic rats.

Twenty patients of angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD) were included in Group I and 20 age and sex-matched controls were included in Group II. Platelet activation was monitored by determining P-selectin (CD62P) expression, intracellular free calcium (Ca(2+)) release and platelet aggregation. In vitro effect of TA on platelets function indices was determined by incubating the platelets with TAE in a time and dose-dependent manner in presence/absence of ADP. TAE was able to significantly inhibit platelet aggregation both in patient and control groups. Significant attenuation in Ca(2+) release and expression of CD62P was also observed with TAE. Our data clearly demonstrates that the bark extract of TA decreases platelet activation and may possess antithrombotic properties.

In the Indian System of Medicine, Hydnocarpus pentandrus (Buch.-Ham.) Oken. is primarily used for treating leprosy and other skin disorders. It is known as \"Chaulmoogra\" and is also used to treat other indications including constipation, inflammation, blood disorders, and worm infestations. Various species of Hydnocarpus are also used in traditional medicine in China, Thailand, Malaysia, and Myanmar for several skin disorders. To assess the therapeutic potential of species from the Hydnocarpus genus and to determine future avenues for research. METHODS: All relevant scientific literature published up to the end of December 2013 was retrieved via a library and electronic search (SciFinder, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar). Manual searches of traditional books like to ancient classics, including Vaidya Yoga Ratnavali, Siddha Materia Medica, and contemporary references including The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India and The Ayurveda Formulary, were also performed. RESULTS: Seed oil from species of the Hydnocarpus genus is used for medicinal purposes, predominantly for various skin disorders. This oil is reported to contain a characteristic class of compounds known as cyclopentenyl fatty acids. Furthermore, seeds of this genus are reported to contain triglycerides of fatty acids, sterols, flavonoids, and flavonolignans. Hydnocarpin, a flavonolignan, is reported to potentiate antimicrobial and anticancer activity. The extracts and compounds isolated from this plant show a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, including antibacterial, antileprotic, antitubercular, antipsoriatic, antirheumatic, hypolipidemic, antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. The antileprotic activity is postulated to be due to the cyclopentenyl fatty acids present in the seed oil. CONCLUSION: Flavonolignans have an interesting chemical motif, and hydnocarpin and its congeners should be investigated for their activities and the mechanism underlying these activities. Multi-drug-resistant microbes are on the increase, and the possible inhibitory effect of these compounds when used with current antimicrobials should also be evaluated. Furthermore, unique cyclopentenyl fatty acids should also be investigated to understand the exact mechanism of action underlying antileprotic activity. Additional in depth phytochemical investigations of seed oil and extracts are required to tap the true potential of species from the Hydnocarpus genus.','28-May-14','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','17-25','1','154','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732111','','');

A total of 45 Ayurvedic clinical trials were identified and grouped into two time periods: pre- and post-2000 periods. Each article was independently reviewed by two calibrated reviewers. RESULTS: Analysis revealed that not 1 of these 45 studies, in either time period, reported \"only-and-full\" use of the 23 available Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria. In fact, 24.4% of these 45 articles never specified any diagnostic criteria at all. While the percentage of articles using Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria (either as \"only use\" or \"combined use with Western Medicine diagnostic criteria\") doubled over the two time periods (27.7% to 59%), rarely were more than 2 of the 23 Ayurvedic diagnostic criteria ever used.

C.','Diarrhoeal diseases: perceptions and practices in Nepal','Social Science & Medicine (1982)','0277-9536','','','A study undertaken in Nepal collected information on believed causes of diarrhoea and traditional treatments. Natural causes for diarrhoea were more frequently reported than supernatural causes, the most important being teething (75% of respondents reporting it to be a cause) followed by food considered to be \'cold\' in the Hindu ayurvedic classification (57.5%), stale food (52.5%), hot food (41%) and dirty water (38%). The terminology reported for dehydration however, indicates strong links with supernatural causes. For prevention of diarrhoea the recognition of the importance of stale food and dirty water is encouraging for health education programmes. Its association with teething may be an obstacle. In the promotion of correct diarrhoea management, the high proportion (83%) of mothers reportedly continuing to breast-feed is a good sign, but 75% of respondents reported that fluids are always or sometimes withheld, and 58% that foods are withheld. The literature does suggest that administration of certain foods and fluids is the commonest form of treatment of diarrhoea, but the choice of these is based upon the hot-cold principle. Both diarrhoea and dysentery were reported to be caused by both \'hot\' and \'cold\' influences in this study. In addition, \'hot\' and \'cold\' foods and fluids were reported to be both useful and harmful in their treatment. Thus, while treatment by giving foods or fluids is suitable, neither \'hot\' nor \'cold\' types will be universally acceptable. The promotion of oral rehydration solution consequently needs to be flexibly manipulated in terms of the hot-cold principle. The current recommendation of its preparation using cold water may be unacceptable in a proportion of cases. A wide variety of nutritious foods and fluids were reported to be considered beneficial and it is concluded that these traditionally accepted feeding practices should be reinforced, especially at the onset of diarrhoea in infants and children.','1989','12/15/2014 19:19','12/15/2014 19:19','593-604','6','28','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2928835','','Breast Feeding; Cultural Characteristics; Culture; Diarrhea; Female; Fluid Therapy; Food Habits; Health Education; Health Services, Indigenous; Humans; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mothers; Nepal');

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the crude methanolic fraction of C. anthelminticum seeds (CAMFs) on Î²-TC6 cell line and confirmed its effects on type 1 and type 2 diabetic rats to understand its mechanism in managing diabetes mellitus. CAMFs were initially tested on Î²-TC6 cells for cytotoxicity, 2-NBDG glucose uptake, insulin secretion and glucose transporter (GLUT-1, 2 and 4) protein expression. Furthermore, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic and STZ-nicotinamide-induced type 2 diabetic rats were intraperitoneally (i.p) injected or administered orally with CAMFs daily for 28 days. The effect of CAMFs on blood glucose and insulin levels was subsequently evaluated. RESULTS: In cell line studies, CAMFs showed non-cytotoxic effect on Î²-TC6 cell proliferation compared to untreated control cells at 50 Î¼g/ml. CAMFs increased glucose uptake and insulin secretion dose-dependently by up-regulating GLUT-2 and GLUT-4 expression in these cells. Further in vivo studies on streptozotocin induced diabetic rat models revealed that CAMFs significantly reduced hyperglycemia by augmenting insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic rats. However, CAMFs displayed less significant effects on type 1 diabetic rats.

This suggests that also natural antioxidants may have therapeutical relevance in neurodegenerative diseases. Studies of Bhattacharya et al. have evidenced that Bacopa monniera (BM) (family Scrophulariaceae), an Ayurvedic medicinal plant clinically used for memory enhancing, epilepsy, insomnia and as a mild sedative, is able to reduce the memory-dysfunction in rat models of Alzheimer\'s disease, but the molecular mechanisms of this action are yet to be determined. In the present study, we examined the effect of a methanolic extract of BM on toxicity induced by the nitric oxide donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP), in culture of purified rat astrocytes. Our results indicate that, after 18 h of treatment, SNAP induced an increase in the production of reactive species, but did not induce the rupture of cellular membrane. Conversely, this NO donor induced a fragmentation of genomic DNA compared to control astrocytes. The extract of BM inhibited the formation of reactive species and DNA damage in a dose dependent manner.

Later on, in Ayurveda it earned a prefix and found way into mythology as \'Rajayakshma\'. After the discovery of streptomycin, the therapeutic management of PTB received a major breakthrough. The treatment module changed remarkably with the formulation of newer anti-tubercular drugs (ATD) with appreciable success. Recent resurgence of PTB in developed countries like United States posed a threat to the medical community due to resistant strains. Consequently, WHO looked toward traditional medicine. Literature reveals that Ayurvedic treatment of PTB was in vogue in India before the introduction of ATD with limited success. Records show that 2766 patients of PTB were treated with Ayurvedic drugs in a tertiary care hospital in Kolkata in the year 1933-1947. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the toxicity reduction and early restoration by adjunct therapy of Ayurvedic drugs by increasing the bio-availability of ATDs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, treatment response of 99 patients treated with ATD as an adjunct with Aswagandha (Withania somnifera) and a multi-herbal formulation described in Chikitsa-sthana of Charaka samhita i.e. Chyawanprash were investigated. Hematological profile, sputum bacterial load count, immunoglobulin IgA and IgM, blood sugar, liver function test, serum creatinine were the assessed parameters besides blood isoniazid and pyrazinamide, repeated after 28 days of treatment. RESULTS: The symptoms abated, body weight showed improvement, ESR values were normal, there was appreciable change in IgA and IgM patterns and significantly increased bioavailability of isoniazid and pyrazinamide were recorded.

The findings here corroborate what other scholars have demonstrated in the case of Asian traditions like Yoga and Ayurveda in the West; these traditions have inevitably undergone shifts in meaning by virtue of their assimilation into the Western, in this case British, holistic health milieu. Most significant in Ayurveda\'s case is the shift away from a preoccupation with remedial medicine (the bedrock of mainstream Ayurveda in modern South Asia), to a focus on self-knowledge and self-empowerment as a path to \'holistic healing\' (understood to address mental and spiritual, not just physical, wellbeing). Even though the Ayurvedic curriculum transmitted at the educational institutions in London is based largely on that taught at Ayurveda colleges in India, the completely different orientations and dispositions of students in Britain (as compared to their South Asian counterparts) ensures that the Ayurveda they go on to apply and practise is radically different - this is \'spiritualised\' Ayurveda, in radical contrast to the \'biomedicalised\' version obtaining in modern mainstream South Asian contexts.','Jan-09','12/15/2014 17:55','12/15/2014 17:55','423-451','2','4','ENG','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20617123','','');

Gum resin from Commiphora wightii (syn C. mukul) has been used for centuries in Ayurveda to treat internal tumors, obesity, liver disorders, malignant sores and ulcers, urinary complaints, intestinal worms, leucoderma (vitiligo), sinuses, edema and sudden paralytic seizures. Guggulsterone has been identified as one of the major active components of this gum resin. This steroid has been shown to bind to the farnesoid X receptor and modulate expression of proteins with antiapoptotic (IAP1, XIAP, Bfl-1/A1, Bcl-2, cFLIP, survivin), cell survival, cell proliferation (cyclin D1, c-Myc), angiogenic, and metastatic (MMP-9, COX-2, VEGF) activities in tumor cells. Guggulsterone mediates gene expression through regulation of various transcription factors, including NF-kappaB, STAT-3 and C/EBPalpha, and various steroid receptors such as androgen receptor and glucocorticoid receptors. Modulation of gene expression by guggulsterone leads to inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, suppression of invasion and abrogation of angiogenesis. Evidence has been presented to suggest that guggulsterone can suppress tumor initiation, promotion and metastasis.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and concentration of heavy metals in Ayurvedic HMPs manufactured in South Asia and sold in Boston-area stores and to compare estimated daily metal ingestion with regulatory standards. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic search strategy to identify all stores 20 miles or less from Boston City Hall that sold Ayurvedic HMPs from South Asia by searching online Yellow Pages using the categories markets, supermarkets, and convenience stores, and business names containing the word India, Indian cities, and Indian words. An online national directory of Indian grocery stores, a South Asian community business directory, and a newspaper were also searched. We visited each store and purchased all unique Ayurvedic HMPs between April 25 and October 24, 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Concentrations (microg/g) of lead, mercury, and arsenic in each HMP as measured by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Estimates of daily metal ingestion for adults and children estimated using manufacturers\' dosage recommendations with comparisons to US Pharmacopeia and US Environmental Protection Agency regulatory standards. RESULTS: A total of 14 (20%) of 70 HMPs (95% confidence interval, 11%-31%) contained heavy metals: lead (n = 13; median concentration, 40 microg/g; range, 5-37,000), mercury (n = 6; median concentration, 20,225 microg/g; range, 28-104,000), and/or arsenic (n = 6; median concentration, 430 microg/g; range, 37-8130). If taken as recommended by the manufacturers, each of these 14 could result in heavy metal intakes above published regulatory standards. CONCLUSIONS: One of 5 Ayurvedic HMPs produced in South Asia and available in Boston South Asian grocery stores contains potentially harmful levels of lead, mercury, and/or arsenic.

Common tumors, such as breast, multiple myeloma, and prostate tumors, frequently metastasize to the bone. It is now well recognized that osteoclasts are responsible for the osteolysis observed in bone metastases of the tumor. Receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand (RANKL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily and an activator of the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, has emerged as a major mediator of bone loss, commonly associated with cancer and other chronic inflammatory diseases. Embelin (2,5-dihydroxy-3-undecyl-1,4-benzoquinone), derived from the Ayurvedic medicinal plant Embelia ribes, has been shown to bind and inhibit X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and inhibit inflammatory pathways. We investigated whether embelin could inhibit osteoclastogenesis-associated bone loss induced by RANKL and by tumor cells in vitro. We found that embelin suppressed the RANKL-induced differentiation of monocytes into osteoclasts. This benzoquinone also suppressed the osteoclastogenesis induced by multiple myeloma and by breast cancer cells. This effect of embelin correlated with the suppression of NF-ÎºB activation and inhibition of IÎºBÎ± phosphorylation and IÎºBÎ± degradation. Inhibition of IÎºBÎ± phosphorylation was due to the inhibition of IÎºBÎ± kinase (IKK) activation. Furthermore, by using an inhibitor of the IKKÎ³ or NF-ÎºB essential modulator (NEMO), the regulatory component of the IKK complex, we showed that the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway is mandatory for RAW 264.7 cell differentiation into osteoclasts.

METHODS: Girls (10-16 years) from two secondary schools of Pune, Maharashtra state, in Western India were enrolled in a cross-sectional study (n = 630). Data were collected on dietary intake, cognitive performance, taste acuity, haemoglobin, erythrocyte zinc and plasma levels of zinc, vitamin C, Î²-carotene and retinol. AMQI was developed using age-sex-specific Indian dietary guidelines and healthy foods and habits described in the recent US dietary guidelines. Zinc-rich recipes were developed considering habitual diets of the girls and vegetarian sources of zinc. An intervention trial (n = 180) was conducted to assess the effect of zinc-rich dietary supplements and ayurvedic zinc (Jasad) supplementation. RESULTS: Prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies was high in these girls. Poor cognitive performance was seen in half of the girls, and salt taste perception was affected in 45%. AMQI was correlated with nutrient intakes and blood micronutrient levels (p < 0.01), indicating the potential of AMQI to measure micronutrient quality of diets of adolescent girls. Results of the intervention trial indicated that supplementation of zinc-rich recipes vis-a-vis ayurvedic Jasad zinc has the potential to improve plasma zinc status, cognitive performance and taste acuity in adolescent girls.

Recently, curcumin has been widely studied for its anticancer properties via its effects on a variety of biological pathways involved in apoptosis, tumor proliferation, chemo- and radiotherapy sensitization, tumor invasion, and metastases. Curcumin can be an effective adjunct in treating solid organ tumors due to its properties of regulating oncogenes like p53, egr-1, c-myc, bcl-XL, etc.; transcription factors like NF-kB, STAT-3, and AP-1; protein kinases like MAPK; and enzymes like COX and LOX. Lung cancer is the most common malignancy worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Seventy-five percent of lung cancer presents at an advanced stage where the existing treatment is not very effective and may result in tremendous patient morbidity.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the preventive effects of curcumin against acute pancreatitis (AP) induced by caerulein in mouse and to elucidate possible mechanism of curcumin action. METHODS: Curcumin (50 mg/kg/day) was intraperitoneally injected to Kun Ming male mice for 6 days, followed by injection of caerulein to induce AP. GW9662 (0.3 mg/kg), a specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³) antagonist, was intravenously injected along with curcumin. Murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells were treated with 100 Î¼mol/l curcumin for 2 h, and then stimulated with 0.1 Î¼ g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Serum amylase and transaminase levels were measured at 10 h after AP. TNF-Î± level in mouse serum and cell culture medium were detected by ELISA. Expression of PPARÎ³ and NF-ÎºB were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Curcumin significantly decreased the pancreas injury and reversed the elevation of serum amylase, ALT and AST activities and TNF-Î± level in mice with AP. Curcumin treatment inhibited the elevation of NF-ÎºB-p65 in the nucleus of mouse pancreas AP group and RAW264.7 cells, but significantly increased the expression of PPARÎ³.

Modern gerontologists are realizing the fact that aging is a disease, which Ayurveda had accepted as natural disease since long. Rate of aging is determined by one\'s biological, social, lifestyle, and psychological conditions and adversity of which leads to accelerated form of aging (Akalaja jara or premature aging). The aim of this study is to identify potential factors that may accelerate aging in the context of dietry factors, lifestyle and mental makeup. The 120 diagnosed subjects of premature-ageing of 30-60 years were randomly selected in the survey study. Premature ageing was common among females (75.83%), in 30-40 age group (70%), 86.67% were married, had secondary level of education (36.66%), house-views (61.67%), belongs top middle class (58.33%) and engaged in occupations that dominating physical labour (88.33%). The maximum patients are constipated (60%), had mandagni (80%), vata-kapha prakriti (48.33%), rajasika prakriti (58.33%), madhyama vyayama shakti (73.33%), and madhyama jarana shakti (85.83%). Collectively, 43.33% patients were above normal BMI. The more patients had anushna (38.33%) and vishamasana dietary pattern (25.83%), consumed Lavana (88.33%) and Amla rasa (78.33%) in excess on regular basis. Some patients had addicted to tobacco (11.67%) and beetle chewing (5.83%). The maximum patients had no any exercise (79.17%) and specific hobby (79.17%) in their leisure times. Analyzing Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating Scales revealed that 39.80%, 37.86%, 33.98%, 24.27% and 18.44% patients had insomnia, depression, tension, GIT symptoms and anxious mood respectively. These data suggest that certain social, dietary and lifestyle factors contribute towards accelerated ageing among young individuals.','Jul-11','12/14/2014 19:27','12/14/2014 19:27','315-321','3','32','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22529643','','');

METHOD: 521 consecutive patients visiting the Hypertension Clinic at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India, over a 6-month period were interviewed. Information was gathered on the patients\' demographics, type(s) of CAM used, sequence of seeking CAM and conventional medicine, sources of recommendation, reasons for opting for CAM and areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction associated with the use of CAM. Patients were also asked if they had informed their doctor about CAM use. RESULTS: It was observed that 63.9% of patients overall used CAM. Ayurveda was the most commonly used CAM (56.7%), followed by herbal medicines (14.4%). The most commonly cited reason by patients for using CAM was fear of adverse drug reactions of conventional medicines (59.0%). However, more than half of the patients eventually became dissatisfied using CAM. Only 5.4% of CAM users had informed their medical doctors about the use of CAM. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients receiving conventional treatment for hypertension also use CAM therapies. A better understanding of the pattern of CAM use amongst these patients will help dispel prevalent misconceptions concerning CAM and, at the same time, assist conventional practitioners to critically evaluate possible gaps or omissions in their own prescribing habits.','Jul-03','12/15/2014 18:22','12/15/2014 18:22','294-298','7','41','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12875345','','Acupuncture; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Complementary Therapies; Female; Humans; Hypertension; India; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Middle Aged; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital; Plant Preparations');

As a result of a defence mechanism to fend off pathogens, Aquilaria species develop agarwood or resin which can be used for incense, perfumery, and traditional medicines. Evidences from ethnopharmacological practices showed that Aquilaria spp. have been traditionally used in the Ayurvedic practice and Chinese medicine to treat various diseases particularly the inflammatory-associated diseases. There have been no reports on traditional use of agarwood towards cancer treatment. However, this is most probably due to the fact that cancer nomenclature is used in modern medicine to describe the diseases associated with unregulated cell growth in which inflammation and body pain are involved. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this current study was therefore to investigate the potential anticancer properties of agarwood essential oil obtained from distillation of agarwood (resin) towards MCF-7 breast cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oil was subjected to screening assays namely cell viability, cell attachment and sulforhodamine B (SRB)-based cytotoxicity assay to determine the IC50 value. RESULTS: The agarwood essential oil caused reduction of the cell number in both the cell viability and attachment assay suggesting a cumulative effect of the cell killing, inhibition of the cell attachment and or causing cells to detach. The agarwood essential oil showed IC50 value of 900 Î¼g/ml towards the cancer cells. CONCLUSION: The agarwood essential oil exhibited anticancer activity which supports the traditional use against the inflammatory-associated diseases. This warrants further investigation towards the development of alternative remedy towards cancer.','Jul-14','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','191-194','3','6','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25002797','','');

OBJECTIVES: To review effects of Ayurvedic medicine or treatments for schizophrenia. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2007) and AMED (March 2007), inspected references of all identified studies and contacted the first author of each included study. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all clinical randomised trials comparing Ayurvedic medicine or treatments with placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently extracted data and calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). MAIN RESULTS: From the three small (total n=250) short included studies, we were unable to extract any data on many broad clinically important outcomes such as global state, use of services, and satisfaction with treatment. When Ayurvedic herbs were compared with placebo, about 20% of people left the studies early (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.37 to 1.62). Mental state ratings were mostly equivocal with the exception of the brahmyadiyoga group using Ayurvedic assessment (n=68, 1 RCT, RR not improved 0.56 CI 0.36 to 0.88, NNT 4 CI 3 to 12). Behaviour seemed unchanged (n=43, 1 RCT, WMD Fergus Falls Behaviour Rating 1.14 CI -1.63 to 3.91). Nausea and vomiting were common in the brahmyadiyoga group (n=43, RR 13.13 CI 0.80 to 216.30). When the Ayurvedic herbs were compared with antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine), again, equal numbers left the study early (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR for brahmyadiyoga 0.91 CI 0.42 to 1.97) but people allocated herbs were at greater risk of no improvement in mental state compared to those allocated chlorpromazine (n=45, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.98). Again, nausea and vomiting were found with use of brahmyadiyoga (n=45, 1 RCT, RR 20.45 CI 1.09 to 383.97, NNH 2 CI 2 to 38). Finally, when Ayurvedic treatment, in this case a complex mixture of many herbs, is compared with chlorpromazine in acutely ill people with schizophrenia, it is equally ( 10% attrition, n=36, RR 0.67 CI 0.13 to 3.53), but skewed data does seem to favour the chlorpromazine group.

Yoga stands third amongst all CAM that is being used by cancer patients today. Different schools of yoga use different sets of practices, with some using a more physical approach and many using meditation and/or breathing. All these modules are developed based on the needs of the patient. This paper is an attempt to provide the basis for a comprehensive need based integrative yoga module for cancer patients at different stages of treatment and follow up. In this paper, the holistic modules of the integrated approach of yoga therapy for cancer (IAYTC) have been developed based on the patient needs, as per the observations by the clinicians and the caregivers. Authors have attempted to systematically create holistic modules of IAYTC for various stages of the disease and treatment. These modules have been used in randomized trials to evaluate its efficacy and have shown to be effective as add-on to conventional management of cancer. Thus, the objective of this effort was to present the theoretical basis and validate the need based holistic yoga modules for cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature from traditional texts including Vedas, Ayurveda, Upanishads, Bhagavat Gita, Yoga Vasishtha etc. and their commentaries were looked into for references of cancer and therapeutic directives. Present day scientific literature was also explored with regards to defining cancer, its etiopathology and its management. Results of studies done using CAM therapies were also looked at, for salient findings. Focused group discussions (FGD) amongst researchers, experienced gurus, and medical professionals involved in research and clinical cancer practice were carried out with the objectives of determining needs of the patient and yoga practices that could prove efficient. A list of needs at different stages of conventional therapies (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy) was listed and yoga modules were developed accordingly. Considering the needs, expected side effects, the energy levels and the psychological states of the participants, eight modules evolved. RESULTS: The results of the six steps for developing the validated module are reported. Step 1: Literature review from traditional yoga and ayurveda texts on etiopathogenesis and management of cancer (arbuda), and the recent literature on cancer stem cells and immunology of cancer. Step 2: Focused group discussions and deliberations to compile the needs of patients based on the expected side effects, energy levels and the psychological state of the patient as observed by the caregivers and the clinicians. Step 3: Content validation through consensus by the experts for the eight modules of IAYTC that could be used as complimentary to conventional management of cancer at different stages during and after the diagnosis was created. Step 4: Field testing for safety and feasibility of the modules through pilot studies. Step 5: Compilation of the results of efficacy trials through RCTs and step 6: A review of our studies on mechanisms to offer evidence for action of IAYTC on psycho-neuro-immunological pathways in cancer. CONCLUSION: The evidence from the traditional knowledge and recent scientific studies validates eight modules of integrated approach of yoga therapy for cancer that can be used safely and effectively as complimentary during all conventional cancer therapies.','2012','12/15/2014 2:38','12/15/2014 2:38','269-282','4','7','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24196801','','Combined Modality Therapy; Evidence-Based Medicine; Focus Groups; Holistic Health; Humans; Mental Health; Neoplasms; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Design; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Yoga');

Extensive research during the last 30 years has revealed much about the biology of cancer. Drugs used to treat most cancers are those that can block cell signalling, including growth factor signalling (e.g., epidermal growth factor); prostaglandin production (e.g., COX-2); inflammation (e.g., inflammatory cytokines: NF-kappaB, TNF, IL-1, IL-6, chemokines); drug resistance gene products (e.g., multi-drug resistance); cell cycle proteins (e.g., cyclin D1 and cyclin E); angiogenesis (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor); invasion (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases); antiapoptosis (e.g., bcl-2, bcl-X(L), XIAP, survivin, FLIP); and cellular proliferation (e.g., c-myc, AP-1, growth factors). Numerous reports have suggested that Ayurvedic plants and their components mediate their effects by modulating several of these recently identified therapeutic targets.

RESULTS: We used the C57BL/6Â J mouse which is known as a counterpart for diet-induced human diabetes and obesity model. Our initial experiments involved two groups of mice, one on normal diet (ND) and the other on high-fat and high-sucrose (HFHSD). The later were then further separated into subgroups that either received no additional treatment, or were treated with different doses of the Ayurvedic formulation KAL-1. At different time points (week3, week6, week9, week12, week15 and week18) eight different tissues were isolated from mice being fed on different diet compositions. These tissues were used to extract gene-expression data through microarray experiment. Simultaneously, we also measured different body parameters like body weight, blood Glucose level and cytokines profile (anti-inflammatory & pro-inflammatory) at each time point for all the groups. CONCLUSION: We identified the early gene-expression signature for the onset of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Further analysis of this data suggests that some of these genes could be used as potential biomarkers for these two disease-states.','30-Aug-14','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','104','1','8','ENG','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231063','','');

In Ayurveda, Chlorophytum borivilianum belongs to the group of \"Vajikaran Rasayana\" corroborated to its rejuvenating, aphrodisiac, natural sex tonic properties and effective in alleviating sexual disorders. It is largely used as ethnic medicine by local healers of indigenous communities of India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A thorough bibliographic investigation was carried out by analyzing worldwide accepted scientific data base (Pub Med, SciFinder, Scopus and Web of Science), thesis, recognized books, non impact and non indexed journals. RESULTS: Traditionally, Chlorophytum borivilianum is well known for treating male impotency in India. The multi therapeutic and nutritional importance of Chlorophytum borivilianum is attributed to the rich source of phytochemicals particularly saponins. Recently, Chlorophytum borivilianum has gained a well established domestic (Indian) and international market for being the herbal alternative of \"Viagra\" without any side effects. Under the trade name \'Nai Chetna\', the state government of Gujarat, India, has launched a novel potency drug from Chlorophytum borivilianum. Modern pharmacological studies of Chlorophytum borivilianum have demonstrated a wide range of pharmacological activities, most importantly aphrodisiac, immunomodulatory and anticancer activities. CONCLUSION: The increased commercial exploitation of Chlorophytum borivilianum and low productivity of this endangered plant has raised the concern over its conservation. It has been envisaged that efforts should be made to standardize, encourage and popularize the cultivation of Chlorophytum borivilianum as a commercial crop. The analysis of previous pharmacological investigations suggested lack of substantial scientific evidences in various studies and do not stand the test of critical assessment. Due to high economic value, Chlorophytum borivilianum has also encountered a problem of adulteration with closely resembling medicinally inferior species.

Myrrh has also been used in the Ayurvedic medical system because of its therapeutic effects against inflammatory diseases, coronary artery diseases, gynecological disease, obesity, etc. AIM OF THE REVIEW: Based on a comprehensive review of traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological and toxicological data on the genus Commiphora, opportunities for the future research and development as well as the genus\' therapeutic potential are analyzed. METHODS: Information on the Commiphora species was collected via electronic search (using Pubmed, SciFinder, Scirus, Google Scholar and Web of Science) and a library search for articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Furthermore, information also was obtained from some local books on ethnopharmacology. This paper covers the literature, primarily pharmacological, from 2000 to the end of December 2011. RESULTS: The resinous exudates from the bark of plants of the genus Commiphora are important indigenous medicines, and have a long medicinal application for arthritis, hyperlipidemia, pain, wounds, fractures, blood stagnation, in Ayurvedic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other indigenous medical systems. Phytochemical investigation of this genus has resulted in identification of more than 300 secondary metabolites. The isolated metabolites and crude extract have exhibited a wide of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological effects, including antiproliferative, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial. The bioactive steroids guggulsterones have attracted most attention for their potent hypolipidemic effect targeting farnesoid X receptor, as well as their potent inhibitory effects on tumor cells and anti-inflammatory efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The resins of Commiphora species have emerged as a good source of the traditional medicines for the treatment of inflammation, arthritis, obesity, microbial infection, wound, pain, fractures, tumor and gastrointestinal diseases. The resin of C. mukul in India and that of C. molmol in Egypt have been developed as anti-hyperlipidemia and antischistosomal agents. Pharmacological results have validated the use of this genus in the traditional medicines. Some bioassays are difficult to reproduce because the plant materials used have not been well identified, therefore analytical protocol and standardization of extracts should be established prior to biological evaluation. Stem, bark and leaf of this genus should receive more attention. Expansion of research materials would provide more opportunities for the discovery of new bioactive principles from the genus Commiphora.','13-Jul-12','12/14/2014 19:27','12/14/2014 19:27','319-330','2','142','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22626923','','Animals; Anti-Infective Agents; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Antioxidants; Commiphora; Humans; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Phytotherapy; Plant Bark; Plant Extracts; Resins, Plant');

(Celastraceae) is an Ayurvedic remedy used for the treatment of a number of diseases, including bowel spasms. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the mode of the relaxing action of a methanolic extract prepared from the seeds of Celastrus paniculatus (CPE, 0.0001-10 microg/mL) in the rat ileum and to try to confirm on human tissues the intestinal pharmacological activity of the extract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The relaxant effect of CPE was studied in vitro by evaluating its effect on the spontaneous contractions of the isolated ileum. RESULTS: CPE exerted a tetrodotoxin- and omega-conotoxin-resistant inhibitory effect on rat ileum motility (IC(50): 0.24+/-0.02 microg/mL; E(max): 99.0+/-0.60%). The inhibitory effect was reduced by nifedipine but not by cyclopiazonic acid. Experiments with specific antagonists enabled us to exclude the involvement of the main endogenous spasmogenic (i.e. acetylcholine and tachykinins) and relaxing (noradrenaline, nitric oxide, ATP) compounds. CPE also relaxed the isolated human ileum (IC(50): 0.26+/-0.02 microg/mL; E(max): 99.1+/-0.46%). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that (i) CPE exerted a powerful myogenic and L-type Ca(2+)-dependent relaxing effect in the isolated rat ileum and that (ii) the human ileum is sensitive to the inhibitory effect of CPE.

Additionally, ginseng may cause headache, tremulousness, and manic episodes in patients treated with phenelzine sulfate. Ginseng should also not be used with estrogens or corticosteroids because of possible additive effects. Since the mechanism of action of St John wort is uncertain, concomitant use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is ill advised. Valerian should not be used concomitantly with barbiturates because excessive sedation may occur.

Both groups received the same Ayurvedic oral medications for 14 days. All steps of randomization and blinding of procedure-based therapy in Ayurveda are described. The physiotherapist evaluated muscle tone, muscle strength, tendon reflexes, range of movement, and balance of functional abilities at baseline, 7 days, and 14 days after starting therapy. Both patient and the assessing physiotherapist were blinded. RESULTS: Intraquartile range values showed better range in patients who received navarakizhi than those who received pinda sweda. DISCUSSION: A larger trial is needed to confirm the superiority of navarakizhi over the rice varieties in treating hemiplegia.

Using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a model pro-oxidant to induce oxidative stress, we have examined the ability of natural food supplement Maharishi Amrit Kalash (MAK-4) to decrease oxidative damage in potassium-arrested isolated rat hearts. The protocol was that hearts isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats were retrograde-perfused with Krebs-Henseleit (K-H) solution for 30 min for equilibration. After this period, the hearts were subjected to cardioplegia with high potassium (26-30 mM), followed by reperfusion with K-H solution in the presence or absence of 200 microM H2O2. As expected, H2O2 treatment following cardioplegia induced a high degree of oxidative stress as assessed by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, a marker of plasma membrane damage) and total glutathione (GSH + GSSG). H2O2 also impaired the ability of heart to regain developed tension during the testing period. However, addition of MAK-4 in the perfusate containing H2O2 decreased oxidative stress in terms of release of LDH and glutathione. In parallel with these biochemical studies, in a few experiments the cardiac function was assessed by measuring developed contractile tension. These preliminary studies also showed that in the presence of MAK-4 the H2O2-treated hearts were able to regain better developed tension. Further in vitro studies to examine the possible mechanisms of MAK-4 action reveal that this formulation contains H2O2 binding activity which resulted in the decreased availability of H2O2 itself. Our studies hence reveal that the ayurvedic food supplement MAK-4 may have potential benefits in reducing oxidative stress.','May-97','12/15/2014 18:53','12/15/2014 18:53','215-222','3','56','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9201611','','Animals; Free Radical Scavengers; Heart; Hydrogen Peroxide; In Vitro Techniques; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardium; Oxidative Stress; Perfusion; Plants, Medicinal; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reactive Oxygen Species');

Such evidence has thrown up insights about the universality of Ayurvedic concepts as well as their apparent association with concepts in current science. This review was undertaken to consolidate the evidence of such associations which exist between prakriti and metabolic systems, chronic diseases, and genotypes with the objective that a case can be made for drawing out the clear linkages that might exist for prakritis being distinct phenotypes representing certain genotypes. A corollary to such discoveries can be the possibility of newborns being screened for their prakriti by genetic testing, which will enable the prevention of various chronic diseases for such children via the implementation of various dietary, lifestyle, and habitual changes, as required, from an early age. This implementation of preventive practices from an early age may result in such children leading healthy, disease-free, more productive lives.

It is expected to become more widely integrated into the modern medical system, including the medical curriculum. Despite the perception of modern medicine as more efficacious, traditional medicine continues to be practiced. More than 70% of the developing world\'s population still depends primarily on the complementary and alternative systems of medicine (CAM). In rural areas, cultural beliefs and practices often lead to self-care, home remedies or consultation with traditional healers. Herbal medicine can be broadly classified into four basic systems as follows: Traditional Chinese Herbalism, Ayurvedic Herbalism, Western Herbalism-which originally came from Greece and Rome to Europe and then spread to North and South America and Traditional Arabic and Islamic Medicine (TAIM). There is no doubt that today the concept of Arabic traditional herbal medicine is a part of modern life in the Middle East, and it is acquiring worldwide respect, with growing interest among traditional herbalists and the scientific community. TAIM therapies have shown remarkable success in healing acute as well as chronic diseases and have been utilized by people in most countries of the Mediterranean who have faith in spiritual healers. TAIM is the first choice for many in dealing with ailments such as infertility, epilepsy, psychosomatic troubles and depression. In parallel, issues of efficacy and safety of complementary medicine have become increasingly important and supervision of the techniques and procedures used is required for commercial as well as traditional uses. More research is therefore needed to understand this type of medicine and ensure its safe usage. The present review will discuss the status of traditional Arab medicine (particularly herbal medicine), including the efficacy and toxicity of specific medicinal preparations, with an emphasis on the modern in vitro and in vivo techniques.','Dec-10','12/15/2014 17:55','12/15/2014 17:55','419-424','4','7','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18955344','','');

Identification of a small molecule that blocks tumor angiogenesis and is safe and affordable has been a challenge in drug development. In this study, we showed that acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), an active component from an Ayurvedic medicinal plant (Boswellia serrata), could strongly inhibit tumor angiogenesis. AKBA suppressed tumor growth in the human prostate tumor xenograft mice treated daily (10 mg/kg AKBA) after solid tumors reached approximately 100 mm(3) (n = 5). The inhibitory effect of AKBA on tumor growth was well correlated with suppression of angiogenesis. When examined for the molecular mechanism, we found that AKBA significantly inhibited blood vessel formation in the Matrigel plug assay in mice and effectively suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced microvessel sprouting in rat aortic ring assay ex vivo. Furthermore, AKBA inhibited VEGF-induced cell proliferation, chemotactic motility, and the formation of capillary-like structures from primary cultured human umbilical vascular endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis and in vitro kinase assay revealed that AKBA suppressed VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) kinase (KDR/Flk-1) with IC(50) of 1.68 micromol/L. Specifically, AKBA suppressed the downstream protein kinases of VEGFR2, including Src family kinase, focal adhesion kinase, extracellular signal-related kinase, AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin, and ribosomal protein S6 kinase. Our findings suggest that AKBA potently inhibits human prostate tumor growth through inhibition of angiogenesis induced by VEGFR2 signaling pathways.','15-Jul-09','12/15/2014 3:03','12/15/2014 3:03','5893-5900','14','69','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19567671','','Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Animals; Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Prostatic Neoplasms; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Signal Transduction; Triterpenes; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2');

Even our biologically close relatives, the great apes, use herbal self-medication (Huffman 2001). Specific herbs and their uses developed regionally, based on locally available plants and through trade in ethnobotanical remedies. Systems of herbal use developed regionally in Europe, the Middle East (Ghazanfar 1994), Africa, India (Behl and Srivastava 2002), China, Japan, Australia, and the Americas. Two well-known systems still in use are the Ayurvedic herbs in India (Kapoor 1990) and herb combinations developed as part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in China (Xu 2004). In Europe and the United States, use of herbs declined as purified extracts and synthetic chemical drugs became available. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of the use of herbs due to the following reasons: the side effects of chemical drugs became apparent, there was a call to return to nature, natural remedies became a part of the green revolution, and there was a return to organic produce. Herbal remedies, including those for skin disorders, are currently gaining popularity among patients and to a lesser degree among physicians. In Asia, especially in China and India, herbal treatments that have been used for centuries are now being studied scientifically. In Germany, the regulatory authority Commission E oversees herbal preparations and their recommended uses (Blumenthal et al. 1998). Currently, the United States does not regulate herbal products except as dietary supplements. There is no standardization of active ingredients, purity, or concentration. There are also no regulations governing which herbs can be marketed for specific indications. Included in this review of herbal medications are those medications that show scientific evidence for clinical efficacy, as well as the more common herbs found to be useful in the treatment of dermatologic disorders. Information regarding the safety of each herb is also included in this chapter to better enable physicians to decide which herbal therapies they may want to use in practice.

In this paper, we show that AMR displays a strong inhibitory effect on survival of human breast carcinoma MDA-468, breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells compared to breast epithelial MCF-10A control cells. A 50% decrease in cells (IC50) ranged from 1.8 to 14.6 microM and cell growth was suppressed by arresting cell cycle at G2 + M phase. AMR effectively induces apoptosis and triggered a series of effects associated with apoptosis including cleavage of caspase-8, -9, -3, Bid and ER stress in MDA-468 cells and caspase- 8, -9, -6 and Bid in MCF-7 cells, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and DNA fragmentation with a concomitant upregulation of p53, Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 in MDA-468 cells, but Bax unchanged in MCF-7 cells. The use of caspase blocking peptides and acridine orange staining confirmed the involvement of primarily caspase-9 and -3 in MDA-468 cells with mutated p53 and primarily caspase-8, -9 and -6 in MCF-7 cells expressing wt p53. We also observed in MCF-7/p53siRNA cells AMR treatment caused reduced expression of Bcl-2 without affecting levels of Bax similar to MCF-7 cells treated with AMR and proteolytic activation of Bax in MDA-468 cells.

Herbs commonly used for this purpose are Zandopa (containing Mucuna pruriens), Withania somnifera, Centella asiatica, Sida cordifolia and Bacopa monnieri. In this study, these herbs were tested for their potential ability to improve climbing ability of a fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) PD model based on loss of function of phosphatase and tensin-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1). Fruit flies were cultured on food containing individual herbs or herbal formulations, a combination of all five herbs, levodopa (positive control) or no treatment (negative control). Tests were performed in both PINK1 mutant flies and healthy wild-type (WT) flies. A significant improvement in climbing ability was observed in flies treated with B.â€‰monnieri compared with untreated PINK1 mutant flies. However, a significant decrease in climbing ability was observed in WT flies for the same herb. Centella asiatica also significantly decreased climbing ability in WT flies. No significant effects were observed with any of the other herbs in either PINK1 or WT flies compared with untreated flies.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY: A quantitative measure of the tridosha level (for vata, pitta, and kapha) is obtained by applying an algorithmic heuristic approach to the exhaustive list of qualitative features/factors that are commonly used by Ayurvedic doctors. A knowledge-based concept of worth coefficients and fuzzy multiattribute decision functions are used here for regression modeling. VALIDATION AND APPLICATIONS: Statistical validation on a large sample shows the accuracy of this study\'s estimates with statistical confidence level above 90%. The estimates are also suited for diagnostic and prognostic applications and systematic drug-response analysis of Ayurvedic (herbal and rasayanam) medicines. An application with regard to the former is elucidated, extensions of which might also be of use in investigating the role of nadis in Ayurvedic healing vis-a-vis acupuncture and acupressure techniques.

The liver was analysed for the degree of lipid peroxidation using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and antioxidant status using the activities of glutathione-dependent enzymes. The degree of liver damage was analysed using serum marker enzyme activities, the total protein, albumin, globulin, ceruloplasmin and liver glycogen contents, and the A/G ratio. The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) of the liver tissues were recorded in the region of 4000-400 cm(-1). The ethanol-fed rats showed significantly elevated liver marker enzyme activities, lipid peroxidation levels and reduced antioxidant levels as compared to the control rats. Oral administration of H. indicus for the latter 30 days resulted in an increased food intake and weight gain, decreased TBARS levels, near normal levels of glutathione-dependent enzymes, increased total protein, albumin, globulin and liver glycogen contents, an increased A/G ratio, and decreased liver marker enzyme activities and ceruloplasmin levels. The relative intensity of the liver FT-IR bands for the experimental groups were found to be altered significantly (p < 0.05) compared to the control samples. For the group that had H. indicus co-administered with ethanol, the intensity of the bands was near normal. Moreover, the results of the FT-IR study correlated with our biochemical results.','2008','12/15/2014 17:55','12/15/2014 17:55','20-37','1','13','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17952378','','Animals; Ethanol; Hemidesmus; Lipid Peroxidation; Liver; Liver Diseases, Alcoholic; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Plant Extracts; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Weight Gain');

It has been used in Ayurveda and folk medicine for the treatment of rheumatism, fever and earache. But its mechanism of anti-inflammatory and analgesic action is still unclear, hence in this context, the objective of our study is to reveal the mechanism of anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of Cardiospermum halicacabum L. which would form an additional proof to the traditional knowledge of Cardiospermum halicacabum L. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study the ethanolic extract of the whole plant was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory action in mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells. The expression levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, COX-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and COX-2 protein expression by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). RESULTS: We found that the ethanol extract dose dependently inhibit mRNA expression of COX-2, TNF-alpha, iNOS and COX-2 protein expression. But the extract did not affect the expression of COX-1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, Cardiospermum halicacabum L. ethanol extract inhibited the TNF-alpha induced DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB, which was associated with decreased p65 protein level in the nucleus in Jurkat cells.

Conventional as well newer molecules have been tried against these targets. Phytochemicals from medicinal plants play a vital role in maintaining the brain\'s chemical balance by influencing the function of receptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitters. In traditional practice of medicine, several plants have been reported to treat cognitive disorders. In this review paper, we attempt to throw some light on the use of medicinal herbs to treat cognitive disorders. In this review, we briefly deal with some medicinal herbs focusing on their neuroprotective active phytochemical substances like fatty acids, phenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, terpenes etc. The resistance of neurons to various stressors by activating specific signal transduction pathways and transcription factors are also discussed. It was observed in the review that a number of herbal medicines used in Ayurvedic practices as well Chinese medicines contain multiple compounds and phytochemicals that may have a neuroprotective effect which may prove beneficial in different neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

Since mechanistic details of therapy in terms of current biology are not available in Ayurvedic literature, modern scientific studies are necessary to understand its major concepts and procedures. It is necessary to examine effects of the whole Ayurvedic formulations rather than their \"active\" components as is done in most current studies. METHODS: We tested two different categories of formulations, a Rasayana (Amalaki Rasayana or AR, an herbal derivative) and a Bhasma (Rasa-Sindoor or RS, an organo-metallic derivative of mercury), for effects on longevity, development, fecundity, stress-tolerance, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) levels of Drosophila melanogaster using at least 200 larvae or flies for each assay. RESULTS: A 0.5% (weight/volume) supplement of AR or RS affected life-history and other physiological traits in distinct ways. While the size of salivary glands, hnRNP levels in larval tissues, and thermotolerance of larvae/adult flies improved significantly following feeding either of the two formulations, the median life span and starvation resistance improved only with AR. Feeding on AR or RS supplemented food improved fecundity differently. Feeding of larvae and adults with AR increased the fecundity while the same with RS had opposite effect. On the contrary, feeding larvae on normal food and adults on AR supplement had no effect on fecundity but a comparable regime of feeding on RS-supplemented food improved fecundity. RS feeding did not cause heavy metal toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The present study with two Ayurvedic formulations reveals formulation-specific effects on several parameters of the fly\'s life, which seem to generally agree with their recommended human usages in Ayurvedic practices.

Picrosides I and II are the active agents responsible for the medicinal effects of Kutki, and the variation in content of these compounds in plants at different altitudes is a major question to be addressed. The picroside I and II content in various plant parts of P. kurrooa collected from different altitudes, viz. Sonemarg (2,740Â m a.s.l.), Tangmarg (2,690Â m a.s.l.), and Pulwama (1,630Â m a.s.l.) in the north-western Kashmir Himalayas was analyzed by HPLC. A considerable degree of variation in picroside content was observed. Picroside I and II was highest in populations collected from Sonemarg followed by Tangmarg, suggesting that picroside accumulation is directly correlated with altitudinal change. More picroside I was found in the rhizome and roots of the Pulwama population as compared to Tangmarg samples, whereas the quantity of Picroside II was reduced in plants from Pulwama compared to the Tangmarg population, suggesting that cultivation of P. kurroa at lower altitude reduces the picroside content. The quantities of picrosides also varied spatially, being highest in rhizome followed by roots, inflorescence and leaves in the populations from all three locations. The study concludes that picroside I and II accumulation depends on altitude, which could help in the selection and collection of superior genotypes with uniform effects for utilization by the pharmaceutical industry.','Jul-11','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','578-582','4-Mar','65','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21347670','','Altitude; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cinnamates; Iridoid Glucosides; Picrorhiza; Plant Extracts');

DESIGN: Mahayograj guggulu, manufactured by Shree Baidynath Ayurved Bhawan Pvt. Ltd., Gwalior Road, Jhansi - 284 003 (of batch number-07 and manufacturing date October 2004) was procured from the local market. Heavy metal concentrations were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. A total of 40 Charles Foster strain albino rats of either sex with an average body weight of 160-250 g were divided into four groups (Groups I, II, III and IV), with 10 animals in each group. Group I served as the control, while Group II, III and IV rats received Mahayograj guggulu at a dose of 54 (dose equivalent to human therapeutic dose), 270 (five-times the dose equivalent to the human therapeutic dose) and 540 (10-times the dose equivalent to human therapeutic dose) mg/kg, p.o. for 120 days. The effect of drug administration was noted on the ponderal, biochemical, hematological and histopathological parameters. In addition, urine examination was also carried out. At the end of the study, only six rats per group were sacrificed as per the IAEC advice. RESULTS: Mahayograj guggulu was found to be safe at all dose levels tested. No significant behavioral changes were noted in any of the groups studied. The effect on food and water consumption and fecal and urine output remained unaffected in all groups during the study period. No major alterations were observed in hematology, serum biochemistry, necropsy and histopathology at the therapeutically advocated dose level. Heavy metal content measurement indicated levels of 25.8 Âµg/g for lead, 0.07 Âµg/g for mercury and 5.19 Âµg/g for arsenic.

INVESTIGATIONS: Laboratory tests showed normocytic anemia (with a hemoglobin concentration of 8.6 g/dl), elevated blood urea and creatinine levels, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hemolysis and polychromasia, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis and basophilic stippling of several red cells. On gastroscopy an ulcer was excluded, ultrasound scan of abdomen, X-ray of chest and pelvis showed no abnormalities. The electrocardiogram showed a right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND COURSE: In the differential diagnosis of anemia with basophilic stippling and abdominal discomfort, lead poisoning was found. Whole-blood lead concentration was markedly raised to 852 micro g/l (normal < 100 micro g/l). Lead poisoning was the result of the use of ayurvedic drugs during a period of 7.5 months prior to admission to the authors\' hospital.

METHODS: SOE (100 mg/kg) was given orally to male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats for 7 weeks. At the end-point of the treatment, the hearts and left ventricles were weighed, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas were measured, and cardiac gene profiles were analysed. On the other hand, angiotensin II-stimulated embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 cells and neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts were pretreated with SOE and one of its prominent components mangiferin (MA), respectively. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA expression and protein synthesis and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation were determined. RESULTS: SOE-treated ZDF rats showed less cardiac hypertrophy (decrease in weights of the hearts and left ventricles and reduced cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas). SOE treatment suppressed cardiac overexpression of ANP, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and AT(1) mRNAs and AT(1) protein in ZDF rats. SOE (50-100 microg/ml) and MA (25 micromol) suppressed angiotensin II-induced ANP mRNA overexpression and protein synthesis in H9c2 cells. They also inhibited angiotensin II-stimulated [(3)H]thymidine incorporation by cardiac fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that SOE decreases cardiac hypertrophy in ZDF rats, at least in part by inhibiting cardiac AT(1) overexpression.

Ionizing radiations interact with biological molecules inducing radiolytic products like e(aq), *OH, *H, -OH, +H, O2, and peroxides. These free radicals damage important biomolecules and subsequently inflict deleterious effects in the organism. Whole-body exposure to ionizing radiations results in central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and bone marrow syndromes, whereas chronic irradiation causes cancer, birth anomalies, erythema, and dysfunctions to almost all organ of the body depending on the total dose and site of irradiation. Curcumin (diferuloyl methane), a yellow pigment present in the rhizomes of turmeric, has been used in Southeast Asia to give yellow color and flavor to curries. Turmeric has been used to treat various ailments in the Ayurvedic system of medicine in India. Recently, it has been evaluated for its radioprotective and radiosensitizing activities. Curcumin has been found to exert a dual mode of action after irradiation depending on its dose. It has been reported to protect various study systems against the deleterious effects induced by ionizing radiation and to enhance the effect of radiation. Therefore, curcumin can be very useful during radiotherapy of cancer. Administration of curcumin in patients will be able to kill the tumor cells effectively by enhancing the effect of radiation and, at the same time, protect normal cells against the harmful effects of radiation. The available information on curcumin suggests that the radioprotective effect might be mainly due to its ability to reduce oxidative stress and inhibit transcription of genes related to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, whereas the radiosensitive activity might be due the upregulation of genes responsible for cell death.','2007','12/15/2014 18:09','12/15/2014 18:09','301-320','','595','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17569217','','Animals; Curcumin; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Humans; Models, Biological; Radiation, Ionizing; Radiation-Protective Agents; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents; Radiation Tolerance');

The putative active compounds are nonvolatile pungent principles, namely gingerols, shogaols, paradols, and zingerone. These compounds are some of the extensively studied phytochemicals and account for the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiemetic, and gastroprotective activities. A number of preclinical investigations with a wide variety of assay systems and carcinogens have shown that ginger and its compounds possess chemopreventive and antineoplastic effects. A number of mechanisms have been observed to be involved in the chemopreventive effects of ginger. The cancer preventive activities of ginger are supposed to be mainly due to free radical scavenging, antioxidant pathways, alteration of gene expressions, and induction of apoptosis, all of which contribute towards decrease in tumor initiation, promotion, and progression. This review provides concise information from preclinical studies with both cell culture models and relevant animal studies by focusing on the mechanisms responsible for the chemopreventive action. The conclusion describes directions for future research to establish its activity and utility as a human cancer preventive and therapeutic drug. The above-mentioned mechanisms of ginger seem to be promising for cancer prevention; however, further clinical studies are warranted to assess the efficacy and safety of ginger.','Jul-11','12/15/2014 2:38','12/15/2014 2:38','499-523','6','51','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21929329','','Animals; Anticarcinogenic Agents; Antiemetics; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Carcinogens; Catechols; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Fatty Alcohols; Ginger; Guaiacol; Humans; Lipid Peroxidation; Neoplasms; Plant Extracts; Protein Carbonylation; Rhizome; Signal Transduction; Spices; Transcription Factors');

Further, some studies show a reduced incidence of colonic cancer. Moreover, cardiovascular benefits have also been identified with almond oil elevating the levels of so-called \'good cholesterol\', high-density lipoproteins (HDL), whilst it reduces low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Historically, almond oil had been used in Ancient Chinese, Ayurvedic and Greco-Persian schools of Medicine to treat dry skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema. Further, it is through anecdotal evidence and clinical experiences that almond oil seemingly reduces hypertrophic scarring post-operatively, smoothes and rejuvenates skin. Almond oil has emollient and sclerosant properties and, therefore, has been used to improve complexion and skin tone. Further studies looking into the use of almond oil post-operatively for the reduction of scarring are suggested.','Feb-10','12/15/2014 3:03','12/15/2014 3:03','12-Oct','1','16','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20129403','','Animals; Cicatrix; History, Ancient; Humans; Plant Extracts; Plant Oils; Prunus');

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 males and 40 females were randomly assigned to the four groups, namely group I (vehicle control; gum acacia), group II (120 mg/kg BW of Immuforte in gum acacia), group III (360 mg/kg BW of Immuforte in gum acacia), and group IV (600 mg/kg BW of Immuforte in gum acacia) consisting of 10 males and 10 females in each group. Additionally, a recovery group (600 mg/kg BW of Immuforte in gum acacia) containing 5 males and 5 females was included. RESULTS: The results showed significant decrease in percent lymphocyte count of high and mid dose groups as compared to control group. The percent neutrophil counts in all the three treated groups of male and female rats were found to be significantly higher than that of control group (P < 0.05). In females MCV values in low dose and mid dose were significantly higher as compared to control (P < 0.05). The males from low dose group showed significant decrease in total serum protein, globulin, electrolytes, direct bilirubin, creatinine levels, whereas in mid dose group along with albumin, globulin. A significant decrease in AST and cholesterol was observed. In females, significant decrease was observed in total protein and globulin of low dose and mid dose of Immuforte-treated rats (P < 0.05). Though few hematological and biochemical parameters were different from control group, no does related response was observed and further, all these values were comparable with historical control data of the colony.

However, in many such settings including in India, many pharmacists and pharmacy workers are often neither well trained nor aware of the intricacies of HIV treatment. The aims of our study were; to determine the availability of ARVs, provision of ARVs, knowledge about ARVs, attitudes towards HIV-infected persons and self-perceived need for training among community-based pharmacies in an urban area of India. METHODS: We performed a survey of randomly selected, community-based pharmacies located in Pune, India, in 2004-2005 to determine the availability of ARVs at these pharmacies, how they were providing ARVs and their self-perceived need for training. We also assessed knowledge, attitudes and perceptions on HIV and ARVs and factors associated with stocking ARVs. RESULTS: Of 207 pharmacies included in the survey, 200 (96.6%) were single, private establishments. Seventy-three (35.3%) pharmacies stocked ARVs and 38 (18.4%) ordered ARVs upon request. The reported median number of ARV pills that patients bought at one time was 30, a two week supply of ARVs (range: 3-240 pills). Six (2.9%) pharmacy respondents reported selling non-allopathic medicines (i.e. Ayurvedic, homeopathy) for HIV. Ninety (44.2%) pharmacy respondents knew that ARVs cannot cure HIV, with those stocking ARVs being more likely to respond correctly (60.3% vs. 34.8%, p = 0.001). Respondents of pharmacies which stocked ARVs were also more likely to believe it was a professional obligation to provide medications to HIV-infected persons (91.8% vs. 78.8%, p = 0.007) but they were also more likely to believe that HIV-infected persons are unable to adhere to their medicines (79.5% vs. 40.9%, p < 0.01). Knowledge of the most common side effects of nevirapine, abnormal liver enzyme profile and skin rash, was reported correctly by 8 (3.9%) and 23 (11.1%) respondents, respectively. Seven (3.4%) respondents reported that they had received special training on HIV, 3 (1.5%) reported receipt of special training on ART and 167 (80.7%) reported that they believed that pharmacy staff should get special training on ART. CONCLUSION: There is a high willingness to participate in HIV management among community-based pharmacies but there is a tremendous need for training on HIV therapies. Furthermore, stigmatizing attitudes towards HIV-infected persons persist and interventions to reduce stigma are needed, particularly among those that stock ARVs.','2010','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','517','','10','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20799948','','Anti-Retroviral Agents; Health Care Surveys; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; HIV Infections; Humans; India; Pharmacies; Questionnaires; Stereotyping');

DESIGN: The 67-item unmÄda specific symptom scale was developed on the basis of translation of Sanskrit verses describing vÄtaja (V), pittaja (P), and kaphaja (K) unmÄda (specific symptoms of psychosis due to the imbalances of metabolic components) and by taking the opinions of experts (15 Ayurveda experts, 5 psychiatrists, and 5 psychologists). SETTINGS: The setting for this study was Spandana Psychiatric Nursing Home Bangalore, India. SUBJECTS: The scale was administered by an unblinded assessor to 30 consecutive patients with nonaffective psychotic disorders. RESULTS: The unmÄda specific symptom scale was associated with excellent internal consistency. The Cronbach\'s alpha for V, P, and K scales were 0.98, 0.98, and 0.97, respectively. The split-half reliability for V, P, and K scales were 0.97, 0.97, and 0.88 respectively. Scores on vÄtaja, pittaja, and kaphaja scales were inversely correlated, suggesting that they are mutually exclusive. The three subgroups of psychoses--paranoid schizophrenia, schizophrenia (unspecified), and unspecified nonorganic psychosis--had significantly different loadings on the three scores, having high scores on vÄtaja, pittaja, and kaphaja, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The tridoshas in psychotic disorders can be measured reliably by this instrument. The scores on each of these doÅŸas help in differentiating three types of psychosis (according to Ayurveda) that have good correspondence with prevailing classification. However, this scale must also be applied to the other 28 separate subcategories of the psychoses that are identified in the International Statistical Classifications of Diseases (version 10) and to the 10 variants of psychosis as defined by the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV-R to help better understand the true utility for use here with the various subcategories of schizophrenia.','Apr-10','12/15/2014 3:03','12/15/2014 3:03','457-462','4','16','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20423215','','Body Constitution; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; India; Individualized Medicine; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychiatry; Psychotic Disorders; Reproducibility of Results');

However to maintain homeostasis, this NF-ÎºB activation profile is only transient. Nevertheless deregulation of NF-ÎºB activity is often observed and can lead to chronic inflammatory diseases as well as cancer. Therefore various research projects focus on the development of therapeutics that target the NF-ÎºB activation pathway. One such compound is Withaferin A from the Ayurvedic plant Withania somnifera. Several reports already described the NF-ÎºB inhibiting, anti-inflammatory capacity of WA, either in vitro as well as in vivo. However the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. In this paper we demonstrate a direct interaction of WA with the IKK-complex, more specifically with IKKÎ², a kinase which is indispensable for the nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB. Hereby WA directly inhibits IKK catalytic activity. By mutation of Cys179 in IKKÎ² we could demonstrate loss of interaction between IKKÎ² and WA indicating that WA exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by targeting the crucial Cys179 residue located in the catalytic site of IKKÎ². Upon docking of WA to a IKKÎ² homology structure model, WA was found to fit nicely into the groove of IKKÎ² where it can form hydrogen bond to stabilize its interaction with Cys179.','15-Oct-14','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','501-509','4','91','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25159986','','');

Objective of this study was to explore the present situation of privately run traditional medicine based health service providing centres in the Kathmandu valley and service users\' perception. METHODS: Data were gathered through interview, observation, and review of relevant documents. Registered health service centres were selected (5 each from Ayurveda, Naturopathy, Homeopathy, Acupuncture and Amchi system of medicine) by simple random method and 132 patients (5-7 from each centre) were selected using convenient sampling. RESULTS: Three of the five systems of traditional medicine (Homeopathy, Amchi and Acupuncture) considered for this study were providing services through clinic level (only OPD services) facilities, while Ayurveda and Naturopathy had hospital (in patient services) level services with number of beds ranging from 10 -25.

Nearly, two third of the patients visited these centres as there was no improvement in their condition at the modern medicine hospitals. More than two third of the patients interviewed perceived the quality of services being satisfactory, while three in ten patients perceived it as very much satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Perception of patients visiting the traditional medicine based centres and the hunger towards more effective service provision by the providers seems to be taking these systems of medicine towards the path of further development. Well recognition and further motivation by the state will help capacitate and strengthen these systems of medicine and garner their proper development in the Nepalese context.','May-13','12/14/2014 18:55','12/14/2014 18:55','177-181','24','11','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24362607','','Community Health Centers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Efficiency, Organizational; Humans; Nepal; Patient Satisfaction; Private Sector; Qualitative Research; Quality of Health Care; Urban Health Services');

The aim of this work was to review and meta-analyze the effectiveness and safety of different Ayurvedic interventions in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). 138 electronic databases were searched through August 2013. Randomized controlled trials, randomized crossover studies, cluster-randomized trials, and non-randomized controlled clinical trials were eligible. Adults with pre-diagnosed OA were included as participants. Interventions were included as Ayurvedic if they were explicitly labeled as such. Main outcome measures were pain, physical function, and global improvement. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 19 randomized and 14 non-randomized controlled trials on 12 different drugs and 3 non-pharmaceutical interventions with a total of 2,952 patients were included. For the compound preparation, Rumalaya, large and apparently unbiased effects beyond placebo were found for pain (standardized mean difference [SMD] -3.73; 95Â % confidence interval [CI] -4.97, -2.50; PÂ <Â 0.01) and global improvement (risk ratio 12.20; 95Â % CI 5.83, 25.54; PÂ <Â 0.01).

Its potential therapeutic effects on a variety of diseases have long been known. Though anti-tumour effects of curcumin have been reported earlier, its mode of action and telomerase inhibitory effects are not clearly determined in brain tumour cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that curcumin binds to cell surface membrane and infiltrates into cytoplasm to initiate apoptotic events. Curcumin treatment has resulted in higher cytotoxicity in the cells that express telomerase enzyme, highlighting its potential as an anticancer agent. Curcumin induced growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in the glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells used in the study. Gene and protein expression analyses revealed that curcumin down-regulated CCNE1, E2F1 and CDK2 and up-regulated the expression of PTEN genes resulting in growth arrest at G2/M phase. Curcumin-induced apoptosis is found to be associated with increased caspase-3/7 activity and overexpression of Bax. In addition, down-regulation of Bcl2 and survivin was observed in curcumin-treated cells. Besides these effects, we found curcumin to be inhibiting telomerase activity and down-regulating hTERT mRNA expression leading to telomere shortening. We conclude that telomerase inhibitory effects of curcumin underscore its use in adjuvant cancer therapy.','Jun-13','12/14/2014 19:14','12/14/2014 19:14','1257-1270','6','114','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23192708','','Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; bcl-2-Associated X Protein; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Membrane; Cell Proliferation; Cell Shape; Curcumin; Cyclin E; DNA Damage; Down-Regulation; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; E2F1 Transcription Factor; G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Gene Expression; Humans; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Telomerase; Telomere Shortening');

The high economic burden associated with asthma is associated primarily with health care costs, missed work or school days. This systematic review was conducted to determine the study quality of articles investigating ayurvedic/collateral herbs, the effectiveness/efficacy and safety profile, as reported in the studies. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Mantis, Ovid, Annotated Bibliography of Indian Medicine, and Cochrane library to identify published trials on herbal medicines for asthma of which Ayruvedic herbals are a subset. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and Quasi-Experimental Designs (QEDs) were included in this systematic review. The classic Jadad Scale, Singh RCT Scale with additional domains than Jadad, Safety Scoring Scale for clinical trials and the Singh QED Scale based on expanded features of QEDs were used to assess study quality. Herbs included in Traditional Chinese Medicine were excluded from this review. Forty-two articles were retrieved and 37 studies were ultimately reviewed utilizing 3 independent evaluators/1 arbitrator. RESULTS: Articles reviewed indicated benefit from most of the herbs used either as a primary or adjunctive treatment for Asthma. Study quality was mixed and therefore caution in interpretation of findings of usefulness of these herbals must be suggested. Limited safety information was mixed and generally was related to GI symptoms, though one herbal investigated reported more serious side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Herbs may be useful in treatment of asthma. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against the use of these herbals. Established effectiveness must be balanced with study quality and safety profile for the herb.','Nov-07','12/15/2014 17:55','12/15/2014 17:55','685-698','9','44','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17994396','','Asthma; Herbal Medicine; Humans; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Phytotherapy; Plants, Medicinal; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic');

Loss of appetite is followed by an undesirable loss of weight due to insufficient amount of calories every day which can lead to loss of muscle mass and strength and other complications by causing interruptions of medical therapy, impeding effective cancer therapy. Mucositis cause decreased immunity and quality of life as well as poor tolerance to surgery and altered efficacy of Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy. The present study is designed with the objective to minimize the radiation induced mucositis, skin reaction, xerostomia, change in voice etc. with an Ayurvedic preparation Yashtimadhu Ghrita (processed ghee).

Furthermore, sperm abnormalities and chromosomal aberrations were insignificant in the treatment group when compared to controls. However, there was a marginal increase in sperm count in the BR treated animals. These findings clearly indicate that there are no observed adverse genotoxic effects elicited by BR in experimental animals such as mice.','Jan-10','12/15/2014 3:03','12/15/2014 3:03','40-44','1','1','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21829300','','');

Accumulative evidences in both in vitro and in vivo studies using berberine demonstrated anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties in different cancer cells. In the present study, a putative compound from commercial sample was purified by chromatographic techniques. The structure of the pure compound was confirmed by spectroscopic studies. The purified berberine was tested against breast cancer (MCF-7) and normal human breast epithelial (MCF-12F) cells for 24, 48 and 72 h at various concentrations. Using MTT assay, berberine exhibited a significant cytotoxic effect on the MCF-7 cells (P<0.01) without affecting the breast normal epithelial cell growth at 25 microM concentration. Based on these results, MCF-7 cells were treated with 25 microM berberine for 48 and 72 h for further studies to illustrate induction of apoptosis through cell cycle distribution and DNA fragmentation with agarose gel electrophoresis. Western blotting with treated cells revealed that berberine induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells through a mitochondria-dependent pathway by increasing levels of cytoplasmic cytochrome c, caspase-9 activity and cleavage of PARP while decreasing levels of Bcl-2. Furthermore, immunoblotting results demonstrated that p53 and p27 were up-regulated suggesting that barberine seems to play a pro-apoptotic role in cancer cells. In conclusion, berberine inhibits the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells through a mitochondria and caspase dependent apoptotic pathway. It is possible that berberine may serve as a potential naturally occurring compound for breast cancer therapy.','25-Oct-10','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','70-78','3-Jan','645','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20691179','','Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; Berberine; Blotting, Western; Breast Neoplasms; Caspases; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cytochromes c; DNA Fragmentation; Female; Humans; Mitochondria; Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53');

In a first experiment, two groups of 20 unmated D. melanogaster strain Oregon-K kept at 22Â°C received either rasayana or standard yeast diet; days of death were recorded. Another experiment investigated possible sex differences; equal sized (N = 30) groups of similar males, females, and controls were compared. Life lengths of all controls were in the strain\'s usual range: in Experiment 1, control life lengths were minimum 40 to maximum 53 days; experimental group figures were 81-91 days; groups were completely separated, experimental group minimum life length being 28 days more than control group maximum life length, i.e., about 2.5 full distribution widths - a sign test for the null hypothesis yields p < 2(-20), i.e., 10(-6) as maximum p. Experiment 2 found no differences between life lengths of males and females; but the maximum life length of 30 controls (60 days in males and 66 days in females) was once again far shorter than the minimum life length of the 60 in the two experimental groups, strengthening the findings of Experiment 1. Despite group sizes being relatively small, results are conclusive: the rasayanas in question increase D. melanogaster strain Oregon-K life length. The complexity of the formulation suggests that multiple mechanisms are involved - worth further investigation.','Apr-10','12/15/2014 3:03','12/15/2014 3:03','114-119','2','1','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21836798','','');

The viability of PC-3 cells, but not a normal prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC), was reduced significantly on treatment with guggulsterone in a concentration-dependent manner. Guggulsterone-mediated suppression of PC-3 cell proliferation was not due to perturbation in cell cycle progression but caused by apoptosis induction characterized by appearance of subdiploid cells and cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation. Guggulsterone-induced apoptosis was associated with induction of multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak. Interestingly, the expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was initially increased in guggulsterone-treated PC-3 cells but declined markedly following a 16- to 24-hour treatment with guggulsterone. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 in PC-3 cells failed to confer significant protection against guggulsterone-induced cell death. On the other hand, SV40 immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Bax-Bak double knockout mice were significantly more resistant to guggulsterone-induced cell killing compared with wild-type cells. Guggulsterone treatment resulted in cleavage (activation) of caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3, and guggulsterone-induced cell death was significantly attenuated in the presence of general caspase inhibitor as well as specific inhibitors of caspase-9 and caspase-8.

Traditionally, it has been used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat proinflammatory conditions. In this report, we hypothesized that AKBA can affect the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) in orthotopically implanted tumors in nude mice. We found that the oral administration of AKBA (50-200 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited the growth of CRC tumors in mice, resulting in decrease in tumor volumes than those seen in vehicle-treated mice without significant decreases in body weight. In addition, we observed that AKBA was highly effective in suppressing ascites and distant metastasis to the liver, lungs and spleen in orthotopically implanted tumors in nude mice. When examined for the mechanism, we found that markers of tumor proliferation index Ki-67 and the microvessel density cluster of differentiation (CD31) were significantly downregulated by AKBA treatment. We also found that AKBA significantly suppressed nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) activation in the tumor tissue and expression of proinflammatory (cyclooxygenase-2), tumor survival (bcl-2, bcl-xL, inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP-1) and survivin), proliferative (cyclin D1), invasive (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9) and angiogenic C-X-C (CXC) receptor 4 and vascular endothelial growth factor) biomarkers. When examined for serum and tissue levels of AKBA, a dose-dependent increase in the levels of the drug was detected, indicating its bioavailability. Thus, our findings suggest that this boswellic acid analog can inhibit the growth and metastasis of human CRC in vivo through downregulation of cancer-associated biomarkers.','1-May-12','12/15/2014 2:38','12/15/2014 2:38','2176-2184','9','130','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21702037','','Animals; Boswellia; Cell Proliferation; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Enzyme Inhibitors; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Triterpenes; Tumor Markers, Biological; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays');

In addition, the exercises outlined here expand upon previously published demonstrations employing Gymnema sylvestre to include illustrations of the different sensory transduction mechanisms associated with each of the four or five primary taste modalities. Students compare their qualitative primary taste experiences to salt, sugar, aspartame, chocolate, and sweet-sour candy prior to and following exposure to Gymnema sylvestre. The herb\'s impairment of sweet sensation is profound and dramatically alters the perception of sweetness in sugar, chocolate, and candy without altering the perception of the other primary tastes.

The primary aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a previously proposed integrative treatment protocol, using locally available resources to address the morbidity, in a community village setting. METHODS: Two LF endemic districts of south India, Gulbarga in Karnataka (GK) and Alleppey in Kerala (AK), were selected for the study. All known patients were invited to an LF camp. Patients with grade two late or three lymphoedema were enrolled. All patients were given training in the integrative procedure which involved patient education and the domiciliary protocol. RESULTS: A total of 730 patients (851 limbs) completed the three and half month follow up. There was a statistically significant (1%) reduction up to mid thigh level volume measurement for both small (0.7-1.1 liters) and large (1.8-5.0 liters) limbs, p < 0.000. In AK inflammatory episodes at the three months interval reduced from 37.5% (127 patients) to 28.3% (96 patients) and in GK from 37.6% (147 patients) to 10.2% (40 patients), p < 0.000. All patients had reduced bacterial entry points. There was an overall improvement in quality of life in all domains of LF specific quality of life questionnaire p < 0.000.

Because ROS production is implicated in induction of autophagy, which is an evolutionary conserved process for bulk degradation of cellular components including organelles (e.g., mitochondria) and considered a valid cancer chemotherapeutic target, we questioned whether WA treatment resulted in autophagy induction. Indeed exposure of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells as well as a spontaneously immortalized and non-tumorigenic normal human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) to pharmacologic concentration of WA resulted in autophagy as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy, processing of microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 isoform B, and/or acridine orange staining. Inhibition of MDA-MB-231 xenograft growth in vivo by WA administration was also associated with a significant increase in level of LC3 protein in the tumor. However, WA-mediated inhibition of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell viability was not compromised either by pharmacological suppression of autophagy using 3-methyl adenine or genetic repression of autophagy by RNA interference of Atg5, a critical component of the autophagic machinery. Finally, Beclin1 was dispensable for WA-mediated autophagy as well as inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell viability. Based on these observations we conclude that autophagy induction fails to have any meaningful impact on WA-mediated lethality in breast cancer cells, which may be a therapeutic advantage because autophagy serves to protect against apoptosis by several anticancer agents.','Jul-13','12/14/2014 19:14','12/14/2014 19:14','640-650','6','13','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23607597','','Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Ethnopharmacology; Female; Humans; Mammary Glands, Human; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mice, Nude; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Neoplasm Proteins; Protein Transport; Tumor Burden; Withanolides; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays');

Although the Indian Association for Medical Informatics (IAMI) was founded in 1993, proposed by major healthcare delivery institutions, the absence of independent career options in medical informatics in India has resulted either in the exodus of the needed faculty members for supporting education in the field. However, this situation may have been changing in the past few years, but a large gap exists which needs to be filled up quickly. The purpose of this report is to provide an assessment of the present situation of research and training in medical informatics in India, and its implications for future development of the field. OBJECTIVES: To assess the current situation regarding the opportunities for research and education in Medical Informatics in India and related issues like availability of career options. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was sent by postal mail to well-known Indian institutions engaged in medical informatics training and research. In addition, key stakeholders working towards imparting education and awareness on the principles and practice of medical informatics were contacted to provide information about training and research in medical informatics in India. This was a purposive sampling based on prior knowledge. The responses were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of six courses were identified in the survey. These were administered through face to face (F2F), e-learning and other modes of distance learning. In general, most of the students are graduates in medicine (allopathic, homeopathic, ayurvedic), allied sciences (nursing, physiotherapy) and medical administrators or graduates in engineering or library and information sciences. Most of them are also working, thus, the majority of the courses are for part-timers and act as on-job value addition. Most of the courses however do not directly train for jobs. Therefore, as most of the participants are already working somewhere, the question of placement due to the course may not be measurable directly. Since most of the students from India are already employed, by attending this course they gain further insights into health informatics that they want to pursue as a career.','2010','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','106-108','','','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20938581','','Curriculum; Education, Distance; India; Medical Informatics; Questionnaires');

AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was aimed to evaluate the molecular basis for cardioprotective potential of Terminalia arjuna (TA) stem bark, using cell cultures of human monocytic (THP-1) and human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inhibitory effect of alcoholic (TAAE) and aqueous (TAWE) extracts of TA-stem bark was assessed on human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, lipoprotein lipase (LpL) and lipid peroxidation in rat (wistar) liver and heart homogenates. The patterns of H2O2 induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were observed by confocal microscopy. The activities of antioxidant enzymes and reducing power of the cells were measured in a microplate reader. Gene transcripts of proinflammatory markers in THP-1 and HAECs were assayed by real time PCR and levels of inflammatory protein markers by ELISA or flow cytometry. Phytochemical analyses of TAAE and TAWE were done using liquid chromatography, coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). RESULTS: TAAE and TAWE inhibited the lipid peroxidation and HMG-CoA reductase but had no effect on LpL. Both the extracts attenuated H2O2 mediated ROS generation in THP-1 cells by promoting catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, and by sustaining cellular reducing power. TAAE was highly effective in attenuating proinflammatory gene transcripts in THP-1 cells and HAECs, whereas the response to TAWE depended on the type of transcript and cell type. Both extracts decreased the levels of typical inflammatory marker proteins, viz. LPS induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± secreted by THP-1 cells and TNF-Î± induced cell surface adhesion molecules on HAECs, namely vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin. Phytochemical analyses indicated the richness in phenolic compounds and terpenes of TAAE and TAWE, while revealing variability in their metabolite profile. CONCLUSION: Our study scientifically validates the antioxidative and antiinflammatory properties of Terminalia arjuna stem bark. The marked effects on cultured human monocytic and aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) provide the biochemical and molecular basis for therapeutic potential of TA-stem bark against cardiovascular diseases (CVD).','27-Mar-13','12/14/2014 19:14','12/14/2014 19:14','456-464','2','146','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23353898','','Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; Aorta; Catalase; Cell Line; Cells, Cultured; Endothelial Cells; Glutathione Peroxidase; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases; Lipid Peroxidation; Lipopolysaccharides; Lipoprotein Lipase; Liver; Male; Monocytes; Myocardium; Plant Bark; Plant Extracts; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Terminalia; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha');

Massage was considered to be beneficial to health. The classic Ayurveda texts mention massage in this sense and recommend it as an almost indispensible healing factor. To this day, massage is regularly used in India for the promotion of general health and fitness as well as in treating minor health problems. Ayurvedic doctors also employ massage as a complete therapy to be applied systematically in the treatment of serious illness. Massage is most commonly applied to the entire body or individual body parts with the aid of ample amounts of warmed oils and, at times, other substances which are specific to the patient\'s constitution. The usual massage method is similar in some ways to the western method. The Ayurveda system, moreover, has a wide range of special massage methods which are used to treat particular illnesses.

The present study builds on these observations and demonstrates that WA inhibits constitutive as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6)-inducible activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is an oncogenic transcription factor activated in many human malignancies including breast cancer. The WA treatment (2 and 4 Î¼M) decreased constitutive (MDA-MB-231) and/or IL-6-inducible (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) phosphorylation of STAT3 (Tyr(705)) and its upstream regulator Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2; Tyr(1007/1008)) in MDA-MB-231, which was accompanied by suppression of their protein levels especially at the higher concentration. Exposure of MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells to WA also resulted in suppression of (i) transcriptional activity of STAT3 with or without IL-6 stimulation in both cells; (ii) dimerization of STAT3 (MDA-MB-231) and (iii) nuclear translocation of Tyr(705)-phosphorylated STAT3 in both cells. To our surprise, the IL-6-stimulation, either before or after WA treatment, did not have an appreciable effect on WA-mediated apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cell line. The IL-6-stimulated activation of STAT3 conferred a modest protection against WA-mediated suppression of MDA-MB-231 cell invasion. General implication of these findings is that WA can trigger apoptosis and largely inhibit cell migration/invasion of breast cancer cells even after IL-6-induced activation of STAT3, which should be viewed as a therapeutic advantage for this agent.','Nov-10','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','1991-1998','11','31','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20724373','','Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Adhesion; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Dimerization; Female; Humans; Interleukin-6; Luciferases; Phosphorylation; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Withanolides');

In the present trial Ayurvedic drug \"Herbmed,\" which is made up of varuna (Crataeva nurvala) and banana stem (Musa paradisiaca) was assessed to see reduction and/or expulsion of urinary calculi and also to assess the role of these drugs to reduce pain during expulsion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo control trial, total 77 patients with calculi more than 5 mm were included. All patients were evaluated either by X-ray KUB or USG KUB for 3 months. All patients were divided into two groups: group A included patients with calculi 5-10 mm (n = 31) and group B with calculi > 10 mm (n = 30) with either active treatment or placebo in both the groups. All patients were asked to keep a record of number of pain episodes, while severity of pain was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: In group A, there was 33.04% reduction in the size of calculi in the active arm while there was a 5.13% increase in the same group in the placebo arm (p = 0.017). In the other group B, there was an 11.25% reduction in the active arm and a 1.41% reduction in the same group with placebo. In the active arm there was statistically significant lower VAS as compared to the placebo arm in the form of the highest VAS (p = 0.008), average VAS (p = 0.001) and VAS at the first episode of pain (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary experience suggests that the Ayurvedic formulation \"varuna and banana stem\" has promise for the management of upper urinary-tract calculi, especially renal calculi.

Individuals in developing societies have to fight mainly against infectious and communicable diseases, while in the developed world the battles are mainly against lifestyle diseases. Yet, at a very fundamental level, the problems are the same-the fight is against distress, disability, and premature death; against human exploitation and for human development and self-actualisation; against the callousness to critical concerns in regimes and scientific power centres.While there has been great progress in the treatment of individual diseases, human pathology continues to increase. Sicknesses are not decreasing in number, they are only changing in type.The primary diseases of poverty like TB, malaria, and HIV/AIDS-and the often co-morbid and ubiquitous malnutrition-take their toll on helpless populations in developing countries. Poverty is not just income deprivation but capability deprivation and optimism deprivation as well.While life expectancy may have increased in the haves, and infant and maternal mortality reduced, these gains have not necessarily ensured that well-being results. There are ever-multiplying numbers of individuals whose well-being is compromised due to lifestyle diseases. These diseases are the result of faulty lifestyles and the consequent crippling stress. But it serves no one\'s purpose to understand them as such. So, the prescription pad continues to prevail over lifestyle-change counselling or research.The struggle to achieve well-being and positive health, to ensure longevity, to combat lifestyle stress and professional burnout, and to reduce psychosomatic ailments continues unabated, with hardly an end in sight.WE THUS REALISE THAT MORBIDITY, DISABILITY, AND DEATH ASSAIL ALL THREE SOCIETIES: the ones with infectious diseases, the ones with diseases of poverty, and the ones with lifestyle diseases.

It is as though poverty and lifestyle stress have become the modern \"bacteria\" of developing and developed societies, respectively.For those societies afflicted with diseases of poverty, of course, the prime concern is to escape from the deadly grip of poverty-disease-deprivation-helplessness; but, while so doing, they must be careful not to land in the lap of lifestyle diseases. For the haves, the need is to seek well-being, positive health, and inner rootedness; to ask science not only to give them new pills for new ills, but to define and study how negative emotions hamper health and how positive ones promote it; to find out what is inner peace, what is the connection between spirituality and health, what is well-being, what is self-actualisation, what prevents disease, what leads to longevity, how simplicity impacts health, what attitudes help cope with chronic sicknesses, how sicknesses can be reversed (not just treated), etc. Studies on well-being, longevity, and simplicity need the concerted attention of researchers.THE TASK AHEAD IS CUT OUT FOR EACH ONE OF US: physician, patient, caregiver, biomedical researcher, writer/journalist, science administrator, policy maker, ethicist, man of religion, practitioner of alternate/complementary medicine, citizen of a world community, etc. Each one must do his or her bit to ensure freedom from disease and achieve well-being.Those in the developed world have the means to make life meaningful but, often, have lost the meaning of life itself; those in the developing world are fighting for survival but, often, have recipes to make life meaningful. This is especially true of a society like India, which is rapidly emerging from its underdeveloped status. It is an ancient civilization, with a philosophical outlook based on a robust mix of the temporal and the spiritual, with vibrant indigenous biomedical and related disciplines, for example, Ayurveda, Yoga, etc. It also has a burgeoning corpus of modern biomedical knowledge in active conversation with the rest of the world. It should be especially careful that, while it does not negate the fruits of economic development and scientific/biomedical advance that seem to beckon it in this century, it does not also forget the values that have added meaning and purpose to life; values that the ancients bequeathed it, drawn from their experiential knowledge down the centuries.The means that the developed have could combine with the recipes to make them meaningful that the developing have. That is the challenge ahead for mankind as it gropes its way out of poverty, disease, despair, alienation, anomie, and the ubiquitous all-devouring lifestyle stresses, and takes halting steps towards well-being and the glory of human development.','Jan-08','12/15/2014 17:55','12/15/2014 17:55','187-225','1','6','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22013359','','');

Vatastheela, as described in Ayurveda, closely resembles benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) of modern medicine in its signs and symptoms. It is a senile disorder and chiefly affects individuals above the age of 40 years. The symptoms are those of bladder outflow obstruction, with increased frequency of micturition, dribbling, hesitancy, and the features of chronic urinary retention. Surgical management has been accepted as the standard management but is associated with many disadvantages as well as complications, which may not be acceptable at this age. Conservative management with modern medicines is also not free from side effects. So, in this age-group, there is a need for much safer alternative method of management. In this regard, many works have been carried out and shown that the Ayurvedic approach, using natural medicines, is a far better approach. We carried out a comparative study of Mahayavanala Roma Kshara (MRK) and Dhanyaka Gokshura Ghrita (DGG), which are the compounds prescribed for Mutraghata in Ayurvedic literature. The patients were randomly selected from the OPD and IPD of IPGT and RA hospital, Jamnagar, Gujarat, and divided into two groups. In first group, one (500 mg) capsule of MRK was given twice a day with lukewarm water for 45 days; in second group, 10 gm of DGG was given orally twice a day with lukewarm water for 45 days. DGG showed significantly greater relief in the subjective parameters as per International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) than MRK.

Among various sources of isolation, traditionally fermented foods are considered to be rich in Lactobacillus spp., which can be exploited for their probiotic attribute. Antibacterial property of L. plantarum has been demonstrated against various enteric pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo systems. This study was aimed at characterizing L. plantarum isolated from Kutajarista, an ayurvedic fermented biomedicine, and assessing its antagonistic property against a common enteropathogen Aeromonas veronii. RESULTS: We report the isolation of L. plantarum (VR1) from Kutajarista, and efficacy of its cell free supernatant (CFS) in amelioration of cytotoxicity caused by Aeromonas veronii. On the part of probiotic attributes, VR1 was tolerant to pH 2, 0.3% bile salts and simulated gastric juice. Additionally, VR1 also exhibited adhesive property to human intestinal HT-29 cell line. Furthermore, CFS of VR1 was antibacterial to enteric pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas veronii and clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and E. coli. Detailed study regarding the effect of VR1 CFS on A. veronii cytotoxicity showed a significant decrease in vacuole formation and detrimental cellular changes in Vero cells. On the other hand, A. veronii CFS caused disruption of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and actin in MDCK cell line, which was prevented by pre-incubation with CFS of VR1. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report isolation of L. plantarum (VR1) from Kutajarista and characterisation for its probiotic attributes.

The scale was administered on children of the age group 8-12 years in New Generation National public school, Bangalore. RESULTS: This inventory was named CCPI and showed excellent internal consistency. The Cronbach\'s alpha for A, B and C scales were 0.54, 0.64 and 0.64 respectively. The Split - Half reliability scores for A, B and C subscales were 0.64. 0.60 and 0.66 respectively. Factor validity coefficient Scores on each item was above 0.4.

These attributes are similar to the modern concept of adaptogenic agents, which are, known to afford protection to the human physiological system against diverse stressors. The present study was undertaken to investigate the adaptogenic and antistress activity of EuMil against chronic unpredictable, but mild, footshock stress-induced perturbations in behaviour (depression), glucose metabolism, suppressed male sexual behaviour, immunosuppression and cognitive dysfunction in CF strain albino rats. Panex ginseng (PG) was used for comparison. Gastric ulceration, plasma corticosterone levels, serum lipid, hepatic and renal functions were used as the stress indices. These effects were attenuated by EuMil (dose 100 mg/kg, p.o.) and PG (100 mg/kg. p.o.), administered once daily over a period of 14 days, the period of stress induction period. Further, chronic stress also induced glucose intolerance, suppressed male sexual behaviour, induced behavioural despair and cognitive dysfunction and immunosuppression. All these chronic stress-induced perturbations were attenuated, in a dose dependent manner by EuMil and PG. Thus, the results indicate that EuMil has significant adaptogenic and anti-stress, activity, qualitatively comparable to PG, against a variety of behavioural, biochemical and physiological perturbations, induced by unpredictable stress, which has been proposed to be a better indicator of clinical stress than acute stress. The likely contribution of the individual constituents of EuMil in the observed adaptogenic action of the polyherbal formulation, has been discussed.','Oct-02','12/15/2014 18:22','12/15/2014 18:22','1151-1160','10','40','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12693696','','Animals; Female; Herbal Medicine; Homeostasis; Male; Rats; Stress, Physiological');

The aim of the study was to screen selected Indian medicinal plants, having similar ethnopharmacological use for ROCK-II inhibition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Some Indian medicinal plants reported as aphrodisiacs in Ayurveda and modern scientific literature were collected, authenticated and extracted. Direct methanol and successive aqueous extracts of these plants were screened for ROCK-II inhibitory activity using HTRF(Â®)KinEASEâ„¢ STK S2 Kit (Cisbio Bioassays). Relaxant effect of potent extract was recorded on isolated rat corpus cavernosum. RESULTS: Methanolic and successive aqueous extracts of 30 plants were screened for ROCK-II inhibition and 15 herbal extracts showed inhibition ranging between 50 and 88% at 50 Î¼g/mL. While IC(50) of Y-27632, a standard ROCK-II inhibitor, was found to be 163.8 Â± 1.2 nM. The Methanolic extract of Terminalia chebula (METC) with IC(50) value of 6.09 Â± 0.17 Î¼g/mL was found to be most potent and relaxed isolated rat corpus cavernosum significantly (p<0.01). Chebulagic and chebulinic acid of METC were found to inhibit ROCK-II and might be responsible for the inhibitory potential of the extract. The traditional use of plants like Butea frondosa, Syzygium aromaticum, Butea superba, Chlorophytum borivilianum and Mucuna pruriens, as aphrodisiacs and for male sexual disorder (MSD) might be in part due to the ROCK II inhibitory potential of these plants.

Tribal people use Terminalia pallida fruit for the treatment of diabetes and this plant widely used in many other disorders. AIM OF STUDY: The present investigation was to evaluate the antioxidant, biochemical profile and histological studies of qualitatively standardized ethanolic extract of Terminalia pallida fruits (TpFE) against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TpFE was standardized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectroscopy (MS). Rats were pretreated orally with different doses of TpFE (100, 300, and 500mgkg(-1) body weight) and cardioprotective positive control gallic acid (GA) for 30 days prior to isoproterenol (ISO) induced myocardial infarction. The rats were sacrificed, hearts were collected and homogenized for biochemical analysis. The effects on total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), lipid peroxidation (LPO) marker, malondialdehyde (MDA), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), sodium potassium (Na(+)/K(+)), calcium (Ca(2+)) and magnesium (Mg(2+)) adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) were estimated in heart tissue homogenate. RESULTS: Rats administered with ISO showed a significant increase in TC, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C, and MDA and a significant decrease in HDL-C, cardiac marker enzymes - CK, LDH, ALT and AST. ISO significantly reduced antioxidants - CAT, GPx, and membrane bound enzymes - Na(+)/K(+), Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) ATPases. Pretreatment with TpFE (100, 300, and 500mgkg(-1) bw) and GA (15mgkg(-1) bw) for a period of 30 days significantly inhibited the effects of ISO.

Pharmacopoeial preparations like avleha or paka (semi-solid), swarasa (expressed juice), kalka (mass), him (cold infusion) and phanta (hot infusion), kwatha (decoction) and churna (powder) form the backbone of Ayurvedic formulations. Newer guidelines for standardization, manufacture, and quality control, and scientifically rigorous research will be necessary for traditional treatments. This traditional knowledge can serve as powerful search engine that will greatly facilitate drug discovery. PURPOSE: The aim of the present study is to standardize Saubhagya Shunthi Paka in churna (powder) form. The powder form makes this traditional drug more stable for long-term storage and hence, easier to preserve. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saubhagya Shunthi Paka is an ayurvedic formulation containing Shunthi (Zingiber officinalis) as one of its chief ingredients. The basic preparation of this drug is a semisolid. We checked the microbial load and nutrient values (using International Standard IS and Association of Official Analytical chemists AOAC methods) RESULTS: The powdered form of Saubhagya Shunthi Churna yielded a weight loss of approximately 17.64% of the total weight of ingredients. The total energy of Churna (calculated based on nutrient content) was found higher over Paka.

Aqueous extract (A1) and detoxified extract (A2) of the seeds were prepared by a process described in Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) method was developed for the two extracts using different solvent systems. Identical spots were obtained in A1 with reference values (Rf) 0.27, 0.47, and 0.79, whereas A2 showed the absence of spot having Rf value 0.47, which could possibly be the toxin found in the intact seed. A1 and A2 were evaluated for their safety and efficacy. The acute toxicity studies for A1 and A2 revealed that A1 was toxic, whereas A2 was safe at the dose of 2 g/kg. Absence of toxicity in the detoxified extract suggests removal of toxic material in processed seeds. The results obtained for hair growth activity of both the extracts were comparable to that of the standard. However, A2 showed better results in comparison to A1.

According to Ayurvedic concepts, there are 3 humors or Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. The combination of these Doshas in varying degrees leads to one\'s constitution, referred to as Prakruti. Prakruti determines one\'s physical, physiologic, and mental character and disease vulnerability. This clinical study was undertaken to determine the constitutional typing of individuals with known idiopathic Parkinson\'s disease (PD) compared with that of nonparkinsonian controls. This study sought to validate the ancient observation that persons of Vata Prakruti are at risk for nervous system diseases. PD was used as a test case because the exact cause is not known. METHODS: Patients with established PD (n=75) and closely related controls with no known neurologic disease (n=73) were assessed for their Ayurvedic constitution (Prakruti). An Ayurvedic constitutional assessment form and an independent Ayurvedic clinical assessment were used in the patients and controls. RESULTS: The total mean score (Â±standard deviation) for Vata was 11.0Â±3.9 in patients with PD and 6.9Â±3.0 in controls. This finding was significant (p<0.0001), indicating that the incidence of PD is highest in those with Vata Prakruti. The incidence of PD was higher in men than in women. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge gained from this study may be helpful in identifying the vulnerable population, delaying the onset of symptoms, or slowing disease progression or development of treatment-related complications by keeping Vata in balance through anti-Vata diet and lifestyle changes as prescribed in Ayurveda.','Jul-13','12/14/2014 19:14','12/14/2014 19:14','644-649','7','19','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23819563','','Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Constitution; Case-Control Studies; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Humans; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Statistics as Topic; Texas');

While prostaglandine synthesis can be influenced by NSAIDs therapeutical approaches to the 5-lipoxygenase pathway are rare. Resinous extracts of Boswellia serrata (H15, indish incense), known from traditional ayurvedic medicine, decrease leukotriene synthesis in vitro. Case reports suggest a clinical role for that drug. METHODS: Outpatients with active RA have been enrolled into a multicenter controlled trial. Patients received 9 tablets of active drug (3600 mg) or placebo daily in addition to their previous therapy. Doses of NSAIDs could be adjusted on demand. Efficacy parameters, Ritchies Index for swelling and pain, ESR, CRP, pain on VAS and NSAID dose were documented at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after initiation. Mean values and medians were calculated to compare the groups for significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were recruited in 4 centers, the data have been published in abstract form. Only 37 patients (verum 18, placebo 19), enrolled in Ratingen were available for detailed efficacy and safety analysis. All evaluations in these patients were performed by one investigator (G.H.). There was no subjective, clinical or laboratory parameter showing a significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation. The mean NSAID dose reduction reached levels of 5.8% (H15) and 3.1% (placebo). One patient in each group showed a good response in all parameters but 4 patients in each group worsened. The others showed no alteration of their disease. CONCLUSION: Treatment with H15 showed no measurable efficacy.

This article reviews the literature pertaining to Withania somnifera and its botanical constituents as antitumor agents and in conjunction with radiation and chemotherapy treatment. Following a search of MEDLINE and EBSCO databases, it can be concluded that Withania somnifera reduces tumor cell proliferation while increasing overall animal survival time. Furthermore, it has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy while potentially mitigating undesirable side effects. Withania somnifera also reduces the side effects of chemotherapeutic agents cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel without interfering with the tumor-reducing actions of the drugs. These effects have been demonstrated in vitro on human cancer cell lines, and in vivo on animal subjects, but there have been no human trials to date.

In our earlier studies, Mucuna pruriens has been shown to possess antiparkinson and neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson\'s disease. The antioxidant activity of Mucuna pruriens was demonstrated by its ability to scavenge DPPH radicals, ABTS radicals and reactive oxygen species. Mucuna pruriens significantly inhibited the oxidation of lipids and deoxyribose sugar. Mucuna pruriens exhibited divalent iron chelating activity and did not show any genotoxic/mutagenic effect on the plasmid DNA.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that WS prophylaxis could offset neurotoxicant-induced oxidative dysfunctions in developing brain employing a rotenone (ROT) mouse model. Initially, we assessed the potential of WS oral supplements (100-400 mg/ kg b.w/ d, 4wks) to modulate the endogenous levels of oxidative markers in cerebellum (cb) and striatum (st) of prepubertal (PP) mice. Further, we assessed the induction of oxidative stress in cb and st of mice administered with ROT (i.p. 0.5 and 1mg/ kg b.w, 7d). ROT caused significant elevation in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroperoxides (HP) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in both brain regions. Further ROT caused significant perturbations in the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), activity levels of antioxidant enzymes, acetylcholinesterase and mitochondrial dysfunctions suggesting a state of oxidative stress. In a satellite study, we examined the protective effects of WS root powder (400mg/ kg b.w/ d, 4wks) in PP mice challenged with ROT (0.5 mg/ kg b.w/ d, 7 d). WS prophylaxis significantly offset ROT-induced oxidative damage in st and cb as evident by the normalized levels of oxidative markers (MDA, ROS levels and HP) and restoration of depleted GSH levels. Further, WS effectively normalized the NO levels in both brain regions suggesting its antiinflammatory action. Furthermore, WS prophylaxis restored the activity levels of cytosolic antioxidant enzymes, neurotransmitter function and dopamine levels in st. Taken together, these findings suggest that WS prophylaxis has the propensity to modulate neurotoxicant-mediated oxidative impairments and mitochondrial dysfunctions in specific brain regions of mice. While the exact mechanism/s underlying the neuroprotective effects of WS merit further investigation, based on our findings, we hypothesize that it may be wholly or in part due to its ability to enhance GSH, thiols and antioxidant defences in the brain of mice.','Mar-13','12/14/2014 19:27','12/14/2014 19:27','43-56','1','13','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23092410','','Animals; Cerebellum; Corpus Striatum; Dietary Supplements; Male; Mice; Oxidative Stress; Plant Extracts; Plant Roots; Random Allocation; Rotenone; Withania');

The patient complained about progressive muscle weakness, loss of appetite and constipation, sleep disorders as well as muscle and back pain. Clinical examination revealed a tetraparesis without any detectable muscle reflexes and atrophic muscles of the extremities. A bilateral radial paresis was found with a loss of power. INVESTIGATIONS: She presented with a hypochromic, microcytic anaemia with a haemoglobin of 7.9 g/dl. Re-evaluation of her peripheral blood smear showed basophilic stippling of the erythrocytes. Bone marrow biopsy revealed a marked dyserythropoiesis with 50% ring sideroblasts. After the examination of the bone marrow, the blood lead level was found to be grossly elevated up to 880 microg/l. DIAGNOSIS: Re-evaluation of the patient\'s history revealed that she had been to India for an Ayurvedic treatment approach to improve her muscle dystrophia. She had taken regularly 4 different natural plant pills which she had bought in an Ayurvedic health centre. Toxicologic analysis of these pills revealed one to have a lead concentration of 50.4 mg/g. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was treated with 16 infusions of sodium-EDTA followed by a 4-week treatment with dimercaptopropionic acid orally. Her neurological condition improved and the radial paresis resolved gradually so that she could return to work. Her haematological parameters normalized. CONCLUSION: This case report underscores the importance, while asking patients for their drug history, to ask additionally if natural plant medicine is taken or applied regularly. The report reveals that Ayurvedic pills from India may have a high concentration of lead and may cause severe poisoning.','14-Nov-03','12/15/2014 18:22','12/15/2014 18:22','2418-2420','46','128','ger','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14614655','','Adult; Female; Humans; Lead; Lead Poisoning; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Muscular Dystrophies; Phytotherapy; Plants, Medicinal');

This study was conducted in 20 adult patients of either sex with grade II and grade III hemorrhoids at two different hospitals. Patients were randomly allotted to two groups of 10 patients each. Group I patients underwent RBL, whereas patients of group II underwent KSL. Guggul-based Apamarga Kshar Sutra was prepared according to the principles laid down in ancient Ayurvedic texts and methodology standardized by IIIM, Jammu and CDRI, Lucknow. Comparative assessment of RBL and KSL was done according to 16 criteria. Although the two procedures were compared on 15 criteria, treatment outcome of grade II and grade III hemorrhoids was decided chiefly on the basis of patient satisfaction index (subjective criterion) and ability of each procedure to deal with prolapse of internal hemorrhoidal masses (objective criterion): Findings in each case were recorded over a follow-up of four weeks (postoperative days 1, 3, 7, 15 and 30). Statistical analysis was done using Student\'s t test for parametric data and Chi square test & Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric data. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

DESIGN: An animal study using Sprague-Dawley rats. The volume of urine and the total sodium and potassium excreted in the urine by rats in response to orally fed Karavi Panchaka decoction were compared with rats fed with frusemide. Control experiments were done with rats receiving similar volumes of distilled water orally. The Ayurveda drug was prepared in accordance with the traditional method in the laboratory using medicinal plant specimens individually collected and identified. MEASUREMENTS: The volume of urine excreted during a 24-hour period following administration of the Ayurveda drug, frusemide or water was measured. The total sodium and potassium ion concentrations in the urine samples were determined using flame photometry. RESULTS: The Karavi Panchaka decoction clearly showed a statistically significant increase in urine excretion when compared with the control group that received only distilled water. The potassium ion excretion was significantly increased in the Karavi Panchaka decoction treated group when compared to the control group. This increase was statistically similar to that caused by frusemide. Neither drug had a significant effect on sodium ion excretion at the dosages used. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the Karavi Panchaka decoction significantly increases urine and potassium ion excretion in rats, but has no effect on sodium ion excretion at the dosage used. The effect of the Ayurveda drug on urine output as well as the sodium and potassium ion excretion is similar to that of frusemide administered at the dose used in our study.','Sep-06','12/15/2014 18:09','12/15/2014 18:09','93-97','3','51','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17315585','','Animals; Antihypertensive Agents; Diuretics; Furosemide; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Plant Extracts; Potassium; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sodium; Urine');

However, the mechanism of WA-induced apoptosis is not fully understood. The present study was designed to systematically determine the role of tumor suppressor p53 and estrogen receptor-Î± (ER-Î±) in proapoptotic response to WA using MCF-7, T47D, and ER-Î± overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells as a model. WA treatment resulted in induction as well as increased S15 phosphorylation of p53 in MCF-7 cells, but RNA interference of this tumor suppressor conferred modest protection at best against WA-induced apoptosis. WA-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in MCF-7 cells were significantly attenuated in the presence of 17Î²-estradiol (E2). Exposure of MCF-7 cells to WA resulted in a marked decrease in protein levels of ER-Î± (but not ER-Î²) and ER-Î± regulated gene product pS2, and this effect was markedly attenuated in the presence of E2. WA-mediated down-regulation of ER-Î± protein expression correlated with a decrease in its nuclear level, suppression of its mRNA level, and inhibition of E2-dependent activation of ERE2e1b-luciferase reporter gene. Ectopic expression of ER-Î± in the MDA-MB-231 cell line conferred partial but statistically significant protection against WA-mediated apoptosis, but not G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Collectively, these results indicate that WA functions as an anti-estrogen, and the proapoptotic effect of this promising natural product is partially attenuated by p53 knockdown and E2-ER-Î±.','Aug-11','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','614-624','8','50','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21432907','','Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Down-Regulation; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Female; Humans; RNA, Messenger; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Up-Regulation; Withania; Withanolides');

Relevant literature (Bhaishajya Ratnavali, Charaka Samhita, Rasendra Sara Samgraha etc.) reviewed to gather information about Lauha Kalpas. Critical analysis of these Lauha Kalpas reveals that ancient seers administered iron in a better acceptable form. Unlike popular understanding these are not only Khalviya preparations; but Churna (powders), Avaleha (confectionaries), Rasakriya (solidified decoctions), and Putapaka (incinerated) form of preparations are also found. Apart from solid dosage forms, semisolid dosage forms mentioned in classics are very much useful. Unfortunately most of the formulations are not found in the market. Hence Pharmaceutical firms may bring these unique dosage forms in to the market to supply the healthcare needs of the community.

There is a tendency for underreporting their ingestion by patients and the magnitude of their use is underrecognised by Physicians. Herbal hepatotoxicity is not uncommonly encountered, but the precise incidence and manifestations have not been well characterised. AIMS: To review the epidemiology, presentation and diagnosis of herbal hepatotoxicity. This review will mainly discuss single ingredients and complex mixtures of herbs marketed under a single label. METHODS: A Medline search was undertaken to identify relevant literature using search terms including \'herbal\', \'herbs\', \'dietary supplement\', \'liver injury\', \'hepatitis\' and \'hepatotoxicity\'. Furthermore, we scanned the reference lists of the primary and review articles to identify publications not retrieved by electronic searches. RESULTS: The incidence rates of herbal hepatotoxicity are largely unknown. The clinical presentation and severity can be highly variable, ranging from mild hepatitis to acute hepatic failure requiring transplantation. Scoring systems for the causality assessment of drug-induced liver injury may be helpful, but have not been validated for herbal hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity features of commonly used herbal products, such as Ayurvedic and Chinese herbs, black cohosh, chaparral, germander, greater celandine, green tea, Herbalife, Hydroxycut, kava, pennyroyal, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, skullcap, and usnic acid, have been individually reviewed. Furthermore, clinically significant herb-drug interactions are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: A number of herbal medicinal products are associated with a spectrum of hepatotoxicity events.

The study subjects were relatives of patients without history of stroke, attending the outpatient department of the hospital. Trained medical students, interns, and a nurse interviewed subjects using a structured, pretested, open-ended questionnaire. RESULTS: Nine hundred forty-two individuals were interviewed during the study period (56.4% men, mean age 40.1 years, age range 15 to 80 years). Forty-five percent of the subjects did not recognize the brain as the affected organ in stroke. In the multivariate analysis, higher education (P<0.001; odds ratio 2.6; 95%, CI 1.8 to 3.8) and upper socioeconomic status (P<0.005; odds ratio 1.6; CI, 1.1 to 2.2) correlated with a better knowledge of which organ was affected in stroke. Twenty-three percent of the participants did not know a single warning symptom of stroke. Twenty-one percent of the subjects could not identify even a single risk factor for stroke. Seven percent of the study population believed that oil massage would improve stroke victims. A small proportion of subjects believed in witchcraft, faith healing, homeopathic, and ayurvedic treatment (3%).

Ayurveda\'s tridosha theory identifies principles of motion (vata), metabolism (pitta), and structure (kapha) as discrete phenotypic groupings. Patwardhan et al. (2005) hypothesized in a paper published in this journal that there is a genetic connotation to prakriti and as proof of this concept showed a correlation between HLA alleles and prakriti type, establishing a rationale and preliminary experimental support for the concept of an association between HLA alleles and the Ayurvedic tridosha theory of individual prakriti types. This work is both part of and a catalyst for a wider revolution in the scientific investigation of Ayurveda in India, referred to as \"Ayurvedic biology\" and \"AyuGenomics.\" Subsequently, Chen et al. (2007) reported a similar study in this journal using a classification based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of a genetic basis for both Ayurvedic and TCM classifications indicate a commonality between Asia\'s great medical traditions in their diagnostic typologies and a genetic basis for Asian traditional medicine\'s theory of discrete and discernable groupings of psycho-physiologic differences. Accordingly, new horizons have opened for collaborative East-East research and for an individualized approach to disease management and activation of the full range of human potential, as articulated in Ayurveda and TCM.','Jun-08','12/15/2014 17:55','12/15/2014 17:55','571-576','5','14','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18564959','','Body Constitution; Female; Genetic Testing; Health Promotion; HLA-DR Antigens; Humans; India; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mind-Body Therapies; Polymorphism, Genetic; Research Design');

Naloxone did not abolish the analgesic activity in the hot plate test. A 5g/kg of MFL did not impair muscle strength and co-ordination and did not induce sedation. The treatment of 5g/kg of MFL did not show signs of acute toxicity or stress. Fourteen-day oral treatment of 5g/kg of MFL significantly increased the serum activity of AST. Flowering of the tree did not abolish the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of the leaves.

This exploratory study hypothesised that plants of the same dosha-curing group may have similarity at the transcript level. For proving/disproving the hypothesis, cDNA-AFLP and specific expression subset analysis (SESA) were carried out on the Ayurveda-defined active tissues of four representative plants each of the three dosha-balancing groups. cDNA-AFLP analyses indicated that even though the plants belonging to a particular dosha-group may widely differ at the transcript level, there is a small fraction of transcripts that is monomorphic among their active tissues. SESA (Tester-active tissue cDNA; Driver-cDNA from other major tissue[s]) generated 803 subtractive ESTs from the twelve plants that yielded 150 unigenes upon assembly (of ESTs from each plant separately). Cross-plant EST assembly for plants in the same dosha group also corroborated the results.

In order to substantiate the health claims, the herb has drawn considerable scientific attention. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the alterations in primary and secondary metabolites of W. somnifera fruits during its maturity using NMR spectroscopy. METHODOLOGY: Fruits at different stages of development from one week after fertilisation until maturity, classified in seven developmental stages, were analysed by a combined use of one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments. RESULTS: Seventeen metabolites were characterised and quantified from non-polar and polar extracts of different fruit development stages of W. somnifera. The principal component analysis of polar metabolites at different stages could be grossly classified into three metabolic phases, viz. initial phase, developmental phase and maturation phase. CONCLUSION: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of metabolites in W. somnifera fruits indicated specific stages when fruits can be harvested for obtaining substantial bioactive ingredients for desirable pharmacological activity. This study potentially provides a complementary tool for quality control of herbal medicinal products when W. somnifera fruits are used.','2011 Nov-Dec','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','492-502','6','22','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21425379','','Caffeic Acids; Fruit; Lipids; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Plant Extracts; Principal Component Analysis; Quality Control; Solubility; Sucrose; Withania; Withanolides');

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out on 30 healthy volunteers after obtaining written informed consent. They were randomly distributed in three groups. Each group was treated with three different colored capsules containing Ashwagandha, Guduchi and placebo in the dose of 1 capsule (500 mg) twice a day for 6 months. The parameters such as hemoglobin%, Erythorcyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), Malondialdehyde (MDA), Super-Oxide Dismutase (SOD) level, etc., were assessed before and after treatment. The Student\'s t-test was applied to assess significant variations in all of the studied parameters. RESULTS: In this study, there was a significant increase in SOD level and decrease in MDA level in Ashwagandha and Guduchi groups.

PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of overweight/obese adult community members from Tucson, Arizona interested in a \"holistic weight loss program\" and meeting predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. INTERVENTION: A comprehensive diet, activity, and lifestyle modification program based on principles of Ayurvedic medicine/yoga therapy with significant self-monitoring of lifestyle behaviors. The 3-month program was designed to change eating and activity patterns and to improve self-efficacy, quality of life, well-being, vitality, and self-awareness around food choices, stress management, and barriers to weight loss. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in body weight, body mass index; body fat percentage, fat/lean mass, waist/hip circumference and ratio, and blood pressure. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Diet and exercise self-efficacy scales; perceived stress scale; visual analog scales (VAS) of energy, appetite, stress, quality of life, well-being, and program satisfaction at all time points.

The practice of yoga is based on the following assumptions: complexity and multidimensionality, various positive influences on an individual\'s wholeness through the mind, body, and the relationships between them. These assumptions may have the potential to contribute towards the practice of physiotherapy and its underlying principles. The essence of physiotherapy as a multifaceted process requires teamwork and efforts of various specialists like psychologists, sociologists, occupational therapists and nurses if patients are to benefit. Ideally, the physiotherapist should possess knowledge from these areas of science in order to professionally care about patients. Therefore, it can be suggested that basic similarities exist between yoga and physiotherapy in terms of mutidisciplinarity and complexity of holistic care. Such conceptual enrichment may be a useful source of inspiration for physiotherapists concerned about their patients\' overall health on a daily basis.

Extensive research over the last half century has revealed several important functions of curcumin. It binds to a variety of proteins and inhibits the activity of various kinases. By modulating the activation of various transcription factors, curcumin regulates the expression of inflammatory enzymes, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and cell survival proteins. Curcumin also downregulates cyclin D1, cyclin E and MDM2; and upregulates p21, p27, and p53. Various preclinical cell culture and animal studies suggest that curcumin has potential as an antiproliferative, anti-invasive, and antiangiogenic agent; as a mediator of chemoresistance and radioresistance; as a chemopreventive agent; and as a therapeutic agent in wound healing, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and arthritis. Pilot phase I clinical trials have shown curcumin to be safe even when consumed at a daily dose of 12g for 3 months. Other clinical trials suggest a potential therapeutic role for curcumin in diseases such as familial adenomatous polyposis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, hypercholesteremia, atherosclerosis, pancreatitis, psoriasis, chronic anterior uveitis and arthritis.

It became recently available as over-the-counter supplements marketed for maintaining a healthy heart. However, the cellular mechanism of its cardiotonic effect remains undefined. The present study was designed to investigate the physicochemical property and inotropic effect of the aqueous extract of TA bark (TA(AqE)) on adult rat ventricular myocytes in comparison with extracts prepared sequentially with organic solvents (organic extracts). The kinetics of myocyte contraction and caffeine-induced contraction were analyzed to assess the effect of TA(AqE) on sarcoplasmic reticular (SR) function. The inotropic effect of TA(AqE) was also compared with that of known cardiotonics, isoproterenol (ISO) and ouabain (Ouab). We found that TA(AqE) decoctions exerted positive inotropy, accelerated myocyte relaxation and increased caffeine-induced contraction concentration-dependently. In contrast, TA organic extracts caused interruption of excitability and arrhythmias without consistent inotropic action. In conclusion, TA(AqE)-induced cardiotonic action via enhancing SR function, a unique action minimizing the occurrence of arrhythmias, makes TA(AqE) a promising and relatively safe cardiotonic beneficial to the healthy heart and the treatment for chronic heart disease. The cardiotonic effect of TA(AqE) is consistent with the therapeutic property of TA bark used in ayurvedic medicine. The method of administration and/or selective omission of hydrophobic components from bark powder could be crucial to the efficacy and safety of TA bark in cardiac therapy and uses as over-the-counter supplements.','15-Feb-11','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','259-265','4','18','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21315570','','Animals; Cardiotonic Agents; Cells, Cultured; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Heart Ventricles; Isoproterenol; Male; Myocytes, Cardiac; Phytotherapy; Plant Bark; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Terminalia');

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fresh juice of the grass was prepared as indicated for use in traditional medicine and standardized for solid content. Its total phenol content was estimated by Folin-Ciocalteau method. Freshly prepared juice was investigated for its effect on doxorubicin-induced DNA damage in vitro. Its immunomodulatory activity was tested on balb/c mice by the humoral antibody response which was determined by haemagglutination antibody titer and spleen cell assay. RESULTS: Fresh juice of Cyanodon dactylon of 1.46% (w/w) solid content had a phenolic content of 47+/-0.33 mg/kg GAE. At doses equivalent to 50, 100 and 200mg total solids/kg body weight the juice protected human DNA against doxorubicin-induced DNA damage as demonstrated in DNA spectral studies, where the ratio of absorbance of DNA at 260 and 280 nm in samples pretreated with the juice was 1.66, 1.53 and 1.63 respectively, while it was 1.37 for DNA treated with doxorubicin only.

Withaferin A (WA), a bioactive compound that is isolated from this plant, has anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulatory, anti-angiogenic, and anti-cancer properties. Here we investigated malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) suppressive effects of WA and the molecular mechanisms involved. WA inhibited growth of the murine as well as patient-derived MPM cells in part by decreasing the chymotryptic activity of the proteasome that resulted in increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins and pro-apoptotic proteasome target proteins (p21, Bax, IÎºBÎ±). WA suppression of MPM growth also involved elevated apoptosis as evidenced by activation of pro-apoptotic p38 stress activated protein kinase (SAPK) and caspase-3, elevated levels of pro-apoptotic Bax protein and cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP). Our studies including gene-array based analyses further revealed that WA suppressed a number of cell growth and metastasis-promoting genes including c-myc. WA treatments also stimulated expression of the cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory protein (CARP)-1/CCAR1, a novel transducer of cell growth signaling. Knock-down of CARP-1, on the other hand, interfered with MPM growth inhibitory effects of WA. Intra-peritoneal administration of 5 mg/kg WA daily inhibited growth of murine MPM cell-derived tumors in vivo in part by inhibiting proteasome activity and stimulating apoptosis. Together our in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that WA suppresses MPM growth by targeting multiple pathways that include blockage of proteasome activity and stimulation of apoptosis, and thus holds promise as an anti-MPM agent.','2012','12/14/2014 19:27','12/14/2014 19:27','e41214','8','7','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22912669','','Animals; Anticarcinogenic Agents; Apoptosis; bcl-2-Associated X Protein; Caspase 3; Caspase 7; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Enzyme Activation; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Mesothelioma; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neoplasm Metastasis; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Proteasome Inhibitors; Withanolides; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays');

Jatyadi Taila (JT) is a medicated oil formulation (Taila) popularly used in the treatment of various topical wounds. AIM OF THE STUDY: Though JT has its composition recorded in ancient Ayurvedic texts, there have been minimal attempts to standardize its use in the management of wound. The current work evaluates the wound healing efficacy of JT and also provides evidence of the dermal absorption kinetics of Karanjin from JT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: JT was subjected to preliminary phytochemical evaluation. Therapeutically active marker components Î²-sitosterol, lupeol and karanjin were detected and separated using HPTLC. As a part of safety evaluation, skin irritation potential of JT was evaluated on rabbit skin. Excision wound model in rats were used to evaluate the wound healing efficacy of JT. Histopathological and biochemical evaluations of excised skin tissues at wound sites were carried out. The HPTLC method developed was also validated to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Karanjin from JT after topical application on pinna of rabbit. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical evaluation of JT revealed presence of flavonoids, essential oils, tannins, glycosides, steroids and alkaloids while resins were found to be absent. HPTLC confirmed the presence of karanjin, lupeol and Î²-sitosterol in JT. JT was found to be non-irritant when applied to the skin of rabbits. Topical application of JT on excision wounds caused significantly faster reduction in wound area as compared to the application of modern topical formulation (Neosporin(Â®)) and untreated control wounds. Animals treated with JT showed significant increase in protein, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content in the granulation tissue when compared with the untreated controls. Wound healing potential of JT was found to be dose dependant. HPTLC method was successfully used to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Karanjin after topical application of JT on rabbit pinna. CONCLUSIONS: Current work demonstrates a modern approach towards standardization of the use of traditional topical formulation JT.

Charles Foster rats (150-200 gms of either sex) were divided into four groups as follows--Group 1 (n = 15) normal animals; Group II (n = 6) rats administered metoclopramide (1.35 mg/kg); Group III (n = 8) rats given atropine (0.45 mg/kg). These agents were injected intramuscularly, 30 mins before the experiment. Rats from Group IV (n = 8) were administered Terminalia chebula (100 mg/kg/day for 15 days orally). Metoclopramide and atropine have established prokinetic and antikinetic activities respectively and are therefore included for comparison. All rats were then given a test meal of methyl cellulose (1.5%) mixed with phenol red (50 mg/100 ml) orally and gastric emptying was measured 20 mins later. Gastric emptying of normal rats (Group I) was found to be 51.6 +/- 7.79%. Metoclopramide significantly increased the gastric emptying (76.33 +/- 12.37%; p < 0.01) and atropine inhibited the motility (% gastric emptying being 7.26 +/- 19.76%; p < 0.01). Terminalia chebula was found to increase the percent gastric emptying (86.57 +/- 6.65%; p < 0.01).

OBJECTIVE: The research team performed the present study to investigate the effects of triphala and its constituents (T bellirica [bibhitaki], T chebula [haritaki], and E officinalis [amalaki]) on the dietary induction of obesity (diet-induced obesity [DIO]), and other symptoms of visceral obesity syndrome, in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). DESIGN: The research team obtained 42 fertile, male, Swiss albino mice, weighing 20 g each, and housed them individually in an approved small-animal facility, in a pathogen-free environment. The team generated DIO mice by feeding them a HFD. SETTING: The study took place at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) in Pilani, India. INTERVENTION: The research team fed all mice, except those in a control group (ND), a HFD for 10 weeks beginning at 7 weeks of age, supplementing the HFDs with herbal treatments for 4 of the groups. The team divided the mice into six weight-matched groups of seven mice each: (1) normal diet (ND), (2) high-fat diet (HFD), (3) triphala (HFD+T), (4) amalaki (HFD+A), (5) haritaki (HFD+H), and (6) bibhitaki (HFD+B). OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team evaluated daily energy intake, fasting plasma glucose, serum lipid profile, and liver cytology. The team measured food and energy intake daily for 10 weeks and measured the body weight of each mouse every third day during the course of the experiment. The team drew blood samples at 2, 4, 8, and 10 weeks posttreatment and determined fasting plasma-glucose concentrations and fasting plasma concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), LDL, HDL, and plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) using commercial kits. At the completion of the study, a pathologist examined the livers and diagnosed a fatty liver based on the presence of macrovesicular or microvesicular fat in the hepatocytes. RESULTS: The research team\'s results showed that mice fed a HFD for a 10-week period, supplemented with herbal preparation(s) of triphala or its constituents, resulted in significant reductions in body weight (P < .0001), energy intake, and percentage of body fat (P < .001), as compared with mice in the HFD group. Herbal treatment significantly improved the lipid profiles of the mice by lowering serum total cholesterol (Total-C), TG, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and increasing levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as compared to the mice in the HFD group. The research team also found that herbal treatment attenuated glucose levels, oral glucose tolerance as measured by the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and levels of ALT. In addition to treatment with its three individual components, treatment with a popular Ayurvedic formulation of triphala also reversed the pathological changes in liver tissue and decreased the relative weight of visceral adipose fat pads. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that triphala and its constituents can counter the effects of an environment (ie, high dietary intake of fats) and have the potential for use as antiobesity agents with desirable lipid-profile modulating properties.','2012 Nov-Dec','12/14/2014 19:14','12/14/2014 19:14','38-45','6','18','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23251942','','Adipose Tissue; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Cholesterol; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Intestinal Absorption; Male; Mice; Obesity; Obesity, Abdominal; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Random Allocation; Treatment Outcome');

Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and homeopathy are practiced in India as non-allopathic systems. These systems comprise a wide range of therapeutic approaches that include diet, herbs, metals, minerals, precious stones and their combinations as well as non-drug therapies. Ayurveda is the oldest system of medicine in the world and by far the most commonly practiced form of non-allopathic medicine in India, particularly in rural India, where 70% of the population lives. The difference between modern medicine and these systems stems from the fact that the knowledge base of many of the above systems, unlike Western medicine, is based on years of experience, observations, empiricism and intuition and has been handed down generations both through word of mouth and treatises. The focus on non-allopathic systems of medicine in India can be attributed to various causes including a need to revive a rich tradition, the dependency of 80% of the country\'s population on these drugs, their easy availability, increasing worldwide use of these medicines, the lack of focused concerted scientific research and the abuse of these systems by quacks. Elsewhere, the increasing use of herbal products worldwide and the growth of the herbal product industry has led to increasing concern regarding their safety. The challenges in these non-allopathic systems relate to the patient, physician, regulatory authorities, the abuse/misuse of these medicines, quality and purity issues. Safety monitoring is mandated by a changing ecological environment, the use of insecticides, new manufacturing techniques, an as yet unregulated pharmaceutical industry, the availability of combinations of herbs over the counter and not mentioned in ancient Ayurvedic texts, and the need to look at the active principles of these medicines as potential chemotherapeutic agents. The Indian traditional medicine industry has come a long way from the times when it was considered unnecessary to test these formulations prior to use, to the introduction of Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines for the industry. However, we still have a long way to go. The conflict between the traditional practitioners and the purists demanding evidence of safety and efficacy needs to be addressed. There is an urgent need for the practitioners of the allopathic and non-allopathic systems to work together to optimise the risk-benefit profile of these medicines.','2002','12/15/2014 18:45','12/15/2014 18:45','1005-1019','14','25','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12408732','','Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; India; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Medicine, Traditional; Metals, Heavy; Physician-Patient Relations; Plants, Medicinal; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Assessment');

The herbo-mineral preparations have several benefits that have been instrumental in their widespread use in treatment of different disorders by traditional medicinal practitioners. These include better stability, lower dosage, ease of storability and sustained availability. Naga bhasma (lead sulphide ash), a traditional Indian herbo-mineral medication prepared using lead and several herbal ingredients, has been used as an oral medicine in India for many years for the treatment of diabetes, spleen enlargement, diarrhoea and various skin diseases. The elaborate preparation protocol involved in the traditional medicines is believed to modify the toxic nature of the precursor (metal) and adds therapeutic value. But modern scientists claim that these preparations are toxic to health as they contain large amount of metal. Many factors such as preparation based factors, chemical nature based factors, vehicle used, therapy associated factors, pharmacological factors, etc, determine whether the traditional medicines are toxic or not. This review focuses on the safety and critical issues associated with Naga bhasma-a lead based ayurvedic medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The detailed review of literature about Naga bhasma apart from other lead based formulations are carried out by utilizing the resources including, classical Indian text books, databases such as Pub med, Scopus, Science direct and few other web sources. RESULTS: Though metallic lead is known to be toxic to the biological system, no compelling evidence has been put forth to suggest any toxic manifestations of Naga bhasma. The elemental characterization of preparations containing Naga bhasma has shown extremely high levels of lead content and various parameters must be taken into consideration in deciding the safety and critical issues present in traditional medicines. As there are no molecular targets available for most of the traditional medicine, it is difficult to assure the safety in using this traditional preparation. Highly intensive research encompassing physico-chemical, engineering as well as biological aspects need to be carried out to understand the applicability of such preparations in a modern context.

On the basis of this traditional usage, dietary supplements containing turmeric rhizome and turmeric extracts are also being used in the western world for arthritis treatment and prevention. However, to our knowledge, no data are available regarding antiarthritic efficacy of complex turmeric extracts similar in composition to those available for use as dietary supplements. Therefore, the studies described here were undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of well-characterized curcuminoid-containing turmeric extracts in the prevention or treatment of arthritis using streptococcal cell wall (SCW)-induced arthritis, a well-described animal model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Arthritic index, a clinical measure of joint swelling, was used as the primary endpoint for assessing the effect of extracts on joint inflammation. An essential oil-depleted turmeric fraction containing 41% of the three major curcuminoids was efficacious in preventing joint inflammation when treatment was started before, but not after, the onset of joint inflammation. A commercial sample containing 94% of the three major curcuminoids was more potent in preventing arthritis than the essential oil-depleted turmeric fraction when compared by total curcuminoid dose per body weight. In conclusion, these data (1) document the in vivo antiarthritic efficacy of an essential oil-depleted turmeric fraction and (2) suggest that the three major curcuminoids are responsible for this antiarthritic effect, while the remaining compounds in the crude turmeric extract may inhibit this protective effect.','Mar-06','12/15/2014 18:09','12/15/2014 18:09','351-355','3','69','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16562833','','Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Curcuma; Curcumin; Medicine, Traditional; Models, Biological; Molecular Structure; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Structure-Activity Relationship');

Triphala (a traditional ayurvedic herbal formulation) incorporated collagen sponge was investigated for its healing potential on infected dermal wound in albino rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanol extract of triphala was prepared and analyzed for the presence of catechin by high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis. Collagen sponge was prepared by incorporating triphala into collagen sponge. The triphala incorporated collagen was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and water uptake analysis. Infected wound was dressed with triphala incorporated collagen sponge. Wound reduction rate, collagen content, and matrix metalloproteinases in the granulation tissue, histology, and Fourier transform electron microscopy analysis were done to obtain the healing pattern. RESULTS: High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis showed the presence of (-)epigallocatechin gallate. FT-IR spectroscopy study revealed the interaction of polyphenols with the collagen. Triphala incorporated collagen sponge has shown to increase thermal stability and water uptake capability, faster wound closure, improved tissue regeneration, collagen content at the wound site, and supporting histopathological parameters pertaining to wound healing.

The aim of this study was to evaluate anti-hepatitis C virus activity present in the Eclipta alba extract, perform bioassay based fractionation and identify anti-HCV phytochemicals from the active fractions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Identification of active compounds was performed by bio-activity guided fractionation approach. Active isolates were separated by the combination of silica gel chromatography and preparative scale reverse phase HPLC. Eclipta alba extract and its isolates were examined for their ability to inhibit HCV replicase (HCV NS5B) activity in vitro and HCV replication in a cell culture system carrying replicating HCV subgenomic RNA replicon. The purified isolates were also examined for their binding affinity to HCV replicase by fluorescence quenching and their cytotoxicity by MTT assay. RESULTS: Eclipta alba extract strongly inhibited RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity of HCV replicase in vitro. In cell culture system, it effectively inhibited HCV replication which resulted in reduced HCV RNA titer and translation level of viral proteins. Bioassay-based fractionations of the extracts and purification of anti-HCV phytochemicals present in the active fractions have identified three compounds, wedelolactone, luteolin, and apigenin. These compounds exhibited dose dependent inhibition of HCV replicase in vitro, and anti-HCV replication activity in the cell culture system CONCLUSION: Eclipta alba extract and phytochemicals isolated from active fractions display anti-HCV activity in vitro and in cell culture system.

Testing was also performed on several batches of one prenatal supplement, with multiple samples tested within each batch. Results were compared to existing toxicant regulatory limits. RESULTS: Toxic element contamination was found in many supplements and pharmaceuticals; levels exceeding established limits were only found in a small percentage of the NHPs tested and none of the drugs tested. Some NHPs demonstrated contamination levels above preferred daily endpoints for mercury, cadmium, lead, arsenic or aluminum. NHPs manufactured in China generally had higher levels of mercury and aluminum. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to toxic elements is occurring regularly as a result of some contaminated NHPs.

Picrorhiza kurroa has a long, creeping rootstock that is bitter in taste, and grows in rock crevices and moist, sandy soil. The leaves of the plant are flat, oval, and sharply serrated. The flowers, which appear June through August, are white or pale purple and borne on a tall spike; manual harvesting of the plant takes place October through December. The active constituents are obtained from the root and rhizomes. The plant is self-regenerating but unregulated over-harvesting has caused it to be threatened to near extinction.

OBJECTIVES: The present study was undertaken to assess the antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic activities of guggulipid in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The screening study included the CCI and L5-L6 SNL models of neuropathic pain. Guggulipid (100 and 50â€‰mg/kg) or saline was administered intraperitoneally in a blinded, randomized manner from postoperative day (POD) 7 to 13. Paw withdrawal duration (PWD) to spontaneous pain, chemical allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were tested before surgery, before and after guggulipid or saline administration (from POD7 to 13) and after the withdrawal of treatment (from POD14 to 20). RESULTS: The activity profiles of the different doses of guggulipid were found to vary with time. In CCI rats, guggulipid (100 and 50â€‰mg/kg) significantly (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) reduced the spontaneous pain, mechanical allodynia and mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia responses and the LD50 of guggulipid was 1600â€‰mg/kg. In SNL rats, both doses of guggulipid were found to be ineffective in reversing the spontaneous pain but showing antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic activity. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that guggulipid produce antinociception in the peripheral nerve injury (CCI and SNL) models of neuropathic pain.

Anti-allergic actions of rottlerin were evaluated in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and passive systemic anaphylaxis mouse models, and in anaphylactic contraction of bronchial rings isolated from sensitized guinea pigs. Direct mast cell-stabilizing effect of rottlerin was examined in RBL-2H3 mast cell line. Anti-allergic signaling mechanisms of action of rottlerin in mast cells were also examined. Rottlerin prevented IgE-mediated cutaneous vascular extravasation, hypothermia, elevation in plasma histamine level and tracheal tissue mast cell degranulation in mice in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, rottlerin suppressed ovalbumin-induced guinea pig bronchial smooth muscle contraction. Furthermore, rottlerin concentration-dependently blocked IgE-mediated immediate release of Î²-hexosaminidase from RBL-2H3 mast cells. Rottlerin was found to inhibit IgE-induced PLCÎ³1 and Akt phosphorylation, production of IP3 and rise in cytosolic CaÂ²âº level in mast cells.

Around 1,250 plants are currently used in various Ayurvedic preparations. Many Indian medicinal plants have come under scientific scrutiny since the middle of the nineteenth century, although in a sporadic fashion. The first significant contribution from Ayurvedic materia medica came with the isolation of the hypertensive alkaloid from the sarpagandha plant (Rouwolfia serpentina), valued in Ayurveda for the treatment of hypertension, insomnia, and insanity. This was the first important ancient-modern concordance in Ayurvedic plants.

METHOD: Information was obtained by computerised and manual searching of medical and botanical data bases, and by discussions with experts in herbal medicine and regulatory aspects of the pharmaceutical industry. RESULTS: Herbal medicines are commonly used in developed and developing countries for psychiatric illness. The main schools of herbal medicine in Australia are Western herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and \'Ayurveda\' (Indian herbal medicine). Herbs used for psychiatric or neurological disorders are termed \'nervines\'. Three nervines which have attracted considerable attention recently are St John\'s Wort, Gingko biloba and Valeriana officinalis. In Australia, most herbal drugs are classed as \'listed drugs\' which are required to satisfy less rigorous safety and efficacy criteria than \'registered drugs\'. The popularity of herbal remedies has a number of clinical and research implications for psychiatry. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatrists should not endorse treatments that are unsupported by sound research, nor remain ignorant about alternative approaches to mental illness. The extent of use of herbal treatments for mental illness suggests that psychiatrists should become more knowledgeable about developments in this area.','Aug-99','12/15/2014 18:45','12/15/2014 18:45','482-489; discussion 490-493','4','33','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10483842','','Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Australia; Education, Medical, Continuing; Humans; Mental Disorders; Patient Care Team; Physician\'s Role; Phytotherapy; Psychiatry');

Ancient texts, translations of these texts, books, and biographical works were consulted to obtain relevant information, both for Indian traditional medicine as well as for Western medicine. Ayurveda has retained principles enunciated by these physicians, with minor conceptual advances over the centuries. Western medicine separated from ancient Indian medicine several hundred years ago, and remains the foundation of modern medicine. Modern medicine is evidence based, and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard by which efficacy of treatment is evaluated. Ayurvedic medicine has not undergone such critical evaluation to any large extent. The few RCTs that have evaluated alternative medical treatment recently have shown that such therapy is no better than placebo; however, placebo treatment is 30% effective.

This pilot study assessed the single-dose effect of Abhyanga, the classic Ayurvedic oil massage, in terms of its impact on subjective stress experience. DESIGN: Ten (10) healthy women (mean [M] 36.4 years, standard deviation [SD] 4.62) and 10 healthy men (M 37.0 years, SD 3.23) underwent a 1-hour Abhyanga massage treatment.

RESULTS: Subjects showed high statistically and clinically significant reductions in subjective stress experience. A consequent analysis of physiologic data indicated likewise reductions in HR, while a BP reduction was not recorded for the total sample, but was only found in the prehypertensive subgroup.

It considers the development of consciousness to be essential for optimal health and meditation as the main technique for achieving this. Treatment of disease is highly individualized and depends on the psychophysiologic constitution of the patient. There are different dietary and lifestyle recommendations for each season of the year.

Among reported techniques, ultraviolet fluorescence and paper chromatography technique are not that much sensitive while other methods require sophisticated instrumental facilities (such as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry) and costly analytical processes. AIMS: The present paper deals with a promising spectroscopic method to determine the tallow adulteration in cow ghee. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ghee and tallow (taken in chloroform) as such and mixed in different proportions were scanned by spectrophotometer and their second order spectra were analyzed. RESULTS: The value of the ratio of the absorbance of peaks at about 238 nm and 297 nm steadily decreases with the increasing proportion of tallow. This decrease shows consistent linearity suggesting its applicability for quantitative estimation of tallow in cow ghee.

The constitutive activation of NF-ÎºB contributes to multiple cellular outcomes and pathophysiological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, AIDS and cancer. Thus there lies a huge therapeutic potential beneath inhibition of NF-ÎºB signalling pathway for reducing these chronic ailments. Withania somnifera, a reputed herb in ayurvedic medicine, comprises a large number of steroidal lactones known as withanolides which show plethora of pharmacological activities like anti- inflammatory, antitumor, antibacterial, antioxidant, anticonvulsive, and immunosuppressive. Though a few studies have been reported depicting the effect of WA (withaferin A) on suppression of NF-ÎºB activation, the mechanism behind this is still eluding the researchers. The study conducted here is an attempt to explore NF-ÎºB signalling pathway modulating capability of Withania somnifera\'s major constituent WA and to elucidate its possible mode of action using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations studies. RESULTS: Formation of active IKK (IÎºB kinase) complex comprising NEMO (NF-ÎºB Essential Modulator) and IKKÎ² subunits is one of the essential steps for NF-ÎºB signalling pathway, non-assembly of which can lead to prevention of the above mentioned vulnerable disorders. As observed from our semi-flexible docking analysis, WA forms strong intermolecular interactions with the NEMO chains thus building steric as well as thermodynamic barriers to the incoming IKKÎ² subunits, which in turn pave way to naive complex formation capability of NEMO with IKKÎ². Docking of WA into active NEMO/IKKÎ² complex using flexible docking in which key residues of the complex were kept flexible also suggest the disruption of the active complex. Thus the molecular docking analysis of WA into NEMO and active NEMO/IKKÎ² complex conducted in this study provides significant evidence in support of the proposed mechanism of NF-ÎºB activation suppression by inhibition or disruption of active NEMO/IKKÎ² complex formation being accounted by non-assembly of the catalytically active NEMO/IKKÎ² complex. Results from the molecular dynamics simulations in water show that the trajectories of the native protein and the protein complexed with WA are stable over a considerably long time period of 2.6 ns. CONCLUSIONS: NF-ÎºB is one of the most attractive topics in current biological, biochemical, and pharmacological research, and in the recent years the number of studies focusing on its inhibition/regulation has increased manifolds. Small ligands (both natural and synthetic) are gaining particular attention in this context. Our computational analysis provided a rationalization of the ability of naturally occurring withaferin A to alter the NF-ÎºB signalling pathway along with its proposed mode of inhibition of the pathway. The absence of active IKK multisubunit complex would prevent degradation of IÎºB proteins, as the IÎºB proteins would not get phosphorylated by IKK. This would ultimately lead to non-release of NF-ÎºB and its further translocation to the nucleus thus arresting its nefarious acts. Conclusively our results strongly suggest that withaferin A is a potent anticancer agent as ascertained by its potent NF-ÎºB modulating capability. Moreover the present MD simulations made clear the dynamic structural stability of NEMO/IKKÎ² in complex with the drug WA, together with the inhibitory mechanism.','2010','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','S25','','11 Suppl 4','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21143809','','Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Differentiation; Cell Nucleus; Cell Proliferation; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Ergosterol; I-kappa B Kinase; I-kappa B Proteins; Medicine, Ayurvedic; NF-kappa B; Phosphorylation; Plant Preparations; Protein Transport; Signal Transduction; Withania; Withanolides');

To testify the Bhasmas various parameters have been told in Rasashastra classics. Tamra Bhasma (TB) with its different properties is used in the treatment of various diseases is quiet famous among the Ayurvedic physicians (Vaidyas). OBJECTIVES: The present study was carried out to set up the quality control parameters for the TB by making the use of classical tests along with advanced analytical tools. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Copper wire taken for the preparation of Bhasma was first analyzed for its copper content and then subjected to Shodhana, Marana and Amrutikarana procedures as per the classical references. Final product complied with all the classical parameters like Rekhapurnatwa, Varitaratwa etc. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After complying with these tests TB was analyzed by advanced analytical techniques like particle size distribution (PSD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and inductive coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP). RESULTS: PSD analysis of TB showed volumetric mean diameter of 28.70 Î¼m, 50% of the material was below 18.40 Î¼m size. Particle size less than 2Î¼m were seen in SEM. 56.24 wt % of copper and 23.06 wt % of sulphur was found in ICP-AES. Heavy metals like cadmium, selenium were not detected while others like arsenic, lead and mercury were present in traces.

Fagonia arabica is an ethno-pharmacologically important Ayurvedic herb known to have many medicinal properties like anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects. However, its antioxidant potential has not been investigated so far. The present study was designed to investigate the antioxidant potential of F. arabica and its neuroprotective effect on chemical ischemia induced in PC12 cells. Chemical ischemia was induced through exposing the cells to uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation sodium azide (5.0 mM) and competitive inhibitor of glycolysis 2-deoxy-glucose (2.0 mM) for 2 h followed by 24 h reperfusion with normal culture medium. Total polyphenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant potential of the herb was measured using DPPH and ABTSâ€¢+ scavenging and ferric ion reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) assays; its effect on neuroprotection and energy metabolism was also studied. The ischemic injury was characterized by impaired energy status as indicated by decreased ATP levels in the cells, accompanied by increased lactic acid content. Both the changes favourably responded to F. arabica and offered considerable neuroprotection from ischemia and helped to maintain the cellular viability and mitochondrial integrity of the cells. F. arabica showed considerable amount of TPC and antioxidant activity. This study reveals the antioxidant potential of F. arabica and its protective efficacy against ischemia/reperfusion mediated cell death. F. arabica thus can be considered for further studies for the development of the prophylactic or therapeutic agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke.','2012','12/15/2014 2:38','12/15/2014 2:38','303-313','1','11','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24250453','','');

It has been assigned a variety of health-promoting effects of which the mechanisms remain unknown. We previously reported the selective killing of cancer cells by leaf extract of Ashwagandha (i-Extract) and its purified component Withanone. In the present study, we investigated its mechanism by loss-of-function screening (abrogation of i-Extract induced cancer cell killing) of the cellular targets and gene pathways. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Randomized ribozyme library was introduced into cancer cells prior to the treatment with i-Extract. Ribozymes were recovered from cells that survived the i-Extract treatment. Gene targets of the selected ribozymes (as predicted by database search) were analyzed by bioinformatics and pathway analyses. The targets were validated for their role in i-Extract induced selective killing of cancer cells by biochemical and molecular assays. Fifteen gene-targets were identified and were investigated for their role in specific cancer cell killing activity of i-Extract and its two major components (Withaferin A and Withanone) by undertaking the shRNA-mediated gene silencing approach. Bioinformatics on the selected gene-targets revealed the involvement of p53, apoptosis and insulin/IGF signaling pathways linked to the ROS signaling. We examined the involvement of ROS-signaling components (ROS levels, DNA damage, mitochondrial structure and membrane potential) and demonstrate that the selective killing of cancer cells is mediated by induction of oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: Ashwagandha leaf extract and Withanone cause selective killing of cancer cells by induction of ROS-signaling and hence are potential reagents that could be recruited for ROS-mediated cancer chemotherapy.','2010','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','e13536','10','5','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20975835','','Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Withania');

The current study examined the effects of standardized extract of Bacopa monniera on the dendritic morphology in adult rats of hippocampal CA3 neurons, one of the regions concerned with learning and memory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult Wistar (2.5-month-old) rats were designated into 2-, 4- and 6-week treatment groups. Rats in each of these groups were divided into 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg dose groups (n=8 for each dose). These rats along with age-matched control rats were then subjected to spatial learning (T-maze) and passive avoidance tests. Subsequent to the T-maze and passive avoidance tests, these rats were killed by decapitation, brains were removed and hippocampal neurons were impregnated with silver nitrate (Golgi staining). Hippocampal CA3 neurons were traced using camera lucida. Dendritic branching points (a measure of dendritic arborization) and dendritic intersections (a measure of dendritic length) were quantified. These data were compared with control rats. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed improvement in spatial learning performance and enhanced memory retention in rats treated with BM extract. There was a significant increase in the dendritic intersections and dendritic branching points along the length of both apical and basal dendrites in rats treated with BM extract for four and six weeks. However, the rats treated with BM extract for two weeks did not show any significant change in hippocampal CA3 neuronal dendritic arborization.

Here, we demonstrate that Z-guggulsterone and an analog, 80-574 currently in clinical trials, act as antagonists of the bile acid receptor (BAR), a member of the intracellular receptor superfamily. These compounds antagonize the activity of BAR in vitro, and in cell culture systems on promoters and endogenous target genes. In biochemical assays, they are able to displace coactivator peptides from the receptor in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanism by which they act as BAR antagonists is likely through their inability to recruit coactivator proteins, failure to release corepressor proteins from unliganded receptor, and ability to compete with BAR agonists to block coactivator recruitment.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of ethanolic extract of Phyllanthus amarus (Phyllanthus amarus) on aflatoxin B(1)-induced liver damage in mice using different biochemical parameters and histopathological studies. Aflatoxin was administered orally (66.6 microg kg(-1)BW 0.2 ml(-1)day(-1)) to the mice of each group except control to which normal saline and ascorbic acid (0.1g kg(-1)BW 0.2 ml(-1)day(-1)) were given, respectively. Ethanolic extract of Phyllanthus amarus (0.3g kg(-1)BW 0.2 ml(-1)day(-1)) was given to all groups except control groups (gp. I and gp. V) after 30 min of aflatoxin administration. The entire study was carried out for 3 months and animals were sacrificed after an interval of 30 days till the completion of study. Phyllanthus amarus extract was found to show hepatoprotective effect by lowering down the content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and enhancing the reduced glutathione level and the activities of antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Histopathological analyses of liver samples also confirmed the hepatoprotective value and antioxidant activity of the ethanolic extract of the herb, which was comparable to the standard antioxidant, ascorbic acid. The overall data indicated that Phyllanthus amarus possesses a potent protective effect against aflatoxin B(1)-induced hepatic damage, and the main mechanism involved in the protection could be associated with its strong capability to reduce the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species by enhancing the level of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants.','25-Sep-07','12/15/2014 17:55','12/15/2014 17:55','503-509','3','113','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17720339','','Aflatoxin B1; Animals; Catalase; Drug-Induced Liver Injury; Ethanol; Glutathione; Glutathione Peroxidase; Glutathione Transferase; Liver Diseases; Male; Mice; Phyllanthus; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Protective Agents; Superoxide Dismutase; Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances');

Wettst is an Ayurvedic herb with antirheumatic potential. This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of Bacopa monniera in treating rheumatoid arthritis using a type II collagen-induced arthritis rat model. Arthritis was induced in male Wistar rats by immunization with bovine type II collagen in complete Freund\'s adjuvant. Bacopa monniera extract (BME) was administered after the development of arthritis from day 14 onwards. The total duration of experiment was 60 days. Paw swelling, arthritic index, inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, myeloperoxidase and serum anti-collagen IgG and IgM levels were analysed in control and experimental rats. Arthritic induction significantly increased paw edema and other classical signs of arthritis coupled to upregulation of inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, neutrophil infiltration and increased anti-collagen IgM and IgG levels in serum. BME significantly inhibited the footpad swelling and arthritic symptoms. BME was effective in inhibiting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities in arthritic rats. Decreased neutrophil infiltration was evident from decreased myeloperoxidase activity and histopathological data where an improvement in joint architecture was also observed. Serum anti-collagen IgM and IgG levels were consistently decreased. Thus the study demonstrates the potential antiarthritic effect of Bacopa monniera for treating arthritis which might confer its antirheumatic activity.','Sep-10','12/15/2014 3:03','12/15/2014 3:03','1377-1383','9','24','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20309843','','Animals; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Experimental; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Bacopa; Cattle; Collagen Type II; Disease Models, Animal; Edema; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Inflammation Mediators; Joints; Lipoxygenase; Male; Neutrophil Infiltration; Peroxidase; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Severity of Illness Index; Up-Regulation');

Information on the C. pluricaulis was collected via electronic search (using Pub Med, SciFinder, Google Scholar and Web of Science) and library search for articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Furthermore, information also was obtained from some local books on ethnopharmacology. This paper covers the literature, primarily pharmacological, from 1985 to the end of 2012. The C. pluricaulis is an important indigenous medicine, which has a long medicinal application for liver disease, epileptic disease, microbial disease, cytotoxic and viral diseases, central nervous system (CNS) disease in Ayurvedic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other indigenous medical systems. The isolated metabolites and crude extract have exhibited a wide of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological effect, including CNS depression, anxiolytic, tranquillizing, antidepressant, antistress, neurodegenerative, antiamnesic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, immunomodulatory, analgesic, antifungal, antibacterial, antidiabetic, antiulcer, anticatatonic, and cardiovascular activity. A chemical study of this plant was then initiated, which led to the isolation of carbohydrats, proteins, alkaloids, fatty acids, steroids, coumarins, flavanoids, and glycosides as active chemicals that bring about its biological effects. A series of pharmacognostical studies of this plant show that it is a herb, its stem and leaves are hairy, more over it has two types of stomata, anisocytic and paracytic. A herb, C. pluricaulis has emerged as a good source of the traditional medicine for the treatment of liver disease, epileptic disease, microbial disease, cytotoxic and viral diseases, and CNS disease. Pharmacological results have validated the use of this species in traditional medicine. All the parts of the herb are known to possess therapeutic benefits.

Agents that can suppress STAT3 activation have potential not only for prevention but also for treatment of cancer. In the present report, we investigated whether 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (plumbagin), an analogue of vitamin K, and isolated from chitrak (Plumbago zeylanica), an Ayurvedic medicinal plant, can modulate the STAT3 pathway. We found that plumbagin inhibited both constitutive and interleukin 6-inducible STAT3 phosphorylation in multiple myeloma (MM) cells and this correlated with the inhibition of c-Src, Janus-activated kinase (JAK)1, and JAK2 activation. Vanadate, however, reversed the plumbagin-induced downregulation of STAT3 activation, suggesting the involvement of a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Indeed, we found that plumbagin induced the expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1, and silencing of the SHP-1 abolished the effect of plumbagin. This agent also downregulated the expression of STAT3-regulated cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, and vascular endothelial growth factor; activated caspase-3; induced poly (ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage; and increased the sub-G(1) population of MM cells. Consistent with these results, overexpression of constitutive active STAT3 significantly reduced the plumbagin-induced apoptosis. When compared with AG490, a rationally designed STAT3/JAK2 inhibitor, plumbagin was found more potent in suppressing the proliferation of cells. Plumbagin also significantly potentiated the apoptotic effects of thalidomide and bortezomib in MM cells. Overall, these results suggest that the plumbagin inhibits STAT3 activation pathway through the induction of SHP-1 and this may mediate the sensitization of STAT3 overexpressing cancers to chemotherapeutic agents.','Jan-10','12/15/2014 3:03','12/15/2014 3:03','107-118','1','8','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20068065','','Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Nucleus; DNA; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Enzyme Induction; Humans; Models, Biological; Naphthoquinones; Phosphorylation; Protein Binding; Protein Transport; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Vitamin K 3');

Ayurvedic texts have described diverse treatment regimens for this disease. AIMS: To determine the change in balance indices, if any, by dynamic posturography (Biodex Balance System, USA) in progressive cerebellar ataxia following Ayurvedic treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a preliminary open labelled study on ten patients diagnosed with progressive cerebellar ataxia. The patients were treated over a period of one month. Treatment consisted of Shirobasti (therapeutic retention of medicament over the scalp) in male patients and Shirodhara (pouring of a steady stream of medicament on the forehead) in female patients with Dhanvantaram tailam (medicated oil) for 45 minutes daily, followed by Abhyanga (methodical massage) with Dhanvantaram tailam and Bhashpa sweda (steam bath), for 14 days. In addition, the treatment also consisted Abhyantara aushadha (oral medicines) of Maharasnadi kashayam 15ml thrice daily, Dhanvantaram capsules 101 two capsules thrice daily, and Ashwagandha tablet 500 mg one tablet thrice daily, for one month. The patients were assessed on the Biodex balance system before and after the treatment. Results were analyzed using paired samples \'t\' test. RESULTS: All patients tolerated the treatment well without any adverse events and reported subjective improvement in walking. There was a statistically significant improvement in the overall and anteroposterior balance indices of dynamic stability.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of present investigation is to study anti-inflammatory activity of Ajuga bracteosa, to understand possible mechanism of action and to identify the constituents responsible for its activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-inflammatory activity of 70% ethanolic extract was evaluated in TPA-induced mouse ear edema assay and in vitro cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activity was determined using EIA kits employing appropriate reference standards. Aajugarin I, lupulin A, withaferin A, reptoside and 6-deoxyharpagide were isolated from the 70% ethanolic extract by silica gel column chromatography. RESULTS: The 70% ethanol extract of whole plants of Ajuga bracteosa showed a significant (p<0.05) and dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity in an acute inflammation model at the dose of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ear. The extract also exhibited a strong in vitro COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activity at 25 and 50 Î¼g/mL concentration. Among the isolated compounds 6-deoxyharpagide exhibited highest COX-2 inhibition while rest of the compounds exhibited weak to moderate COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition at 30 Î¼M concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the 70% ethanol extract of Ajuga bracteosa possesses promising anti-inflammatory activity, which is possibly mediated through inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.

Chemical investigation of the roots and leaves of this plant has yielded bioactive withanolides. Earlier studies showed that withanolides inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes, lipid peroxidation, and proliferation of tumor cells. Because several genes that regulate cellular proliferation, carcinogenesis, metastasis, and inflammation are regulated by activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), we hypothesized that the activity of withanolides is mediated through modulation of NF-kappaB activation. For this report, we investigated the effect of the withanolide on NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression activated by various carcinogens. We found that withanolides suppressed NF-kappaB activation induced by a variety of inflammatory and carcinogenic agents, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1beta, doxorubicin, and cigarette smoke condensate. Suppression was not cell type specific, as both inducible and constitutive NF-kappaB activation was blocked by withanolides. The suppression occurred through the inhibition of inhibitory subunit of IkappaB alpha kinase activation, IkappaB alpha phosphorylation, IkappaB alpha degradation, p65 phosphorylation, and subsequent p65 nuclear translocation. NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression activated by TNF, TNF receptor (TNFR) 1, TNFR-associated death domain, TNFR-associated factor 2, and IkappaB alpha kinase was also suppressed. Consequently, withanolide suppressed the expression of TNF-induced NF-kappaB-regulated antiapoptotic (inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1, Bfl-1/A1, and FADD-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein) and metastatic (cyclooxygenase-2 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1) gene products, enhanced the apoptosis induced by TNF and chemotherapeutic agents, and suppressed cellular TNF-induced invasion and receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand-induced osteoclastogenesis. Overall, our results indicate that withanolides inhibit activation of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression, which may explain the ability of withanolides to enhance apoptosis and inhibit invasion and osteoclastogenesis.','Jun-06','12/15/2014 18:09','12/15/2014 18:09','1434-1445','6','5','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16818501','','Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Apoptosis; Cell Migration Inhibition; Cells, Cultured; Doxorubicin; Enzyme Activation; Ergosterol; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; I-kappa B Kinase; Interleukin-1; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mice; Neoplasm Invasiveness; NF-kappa B; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; Phosphorylation; Plant Extracts; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Withania');

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested time, dose dependent and specific anti-proliferative activity of LE by clonogenic cell survival assay on human cancer and normal epithelial cell lines in vitro. We further investigated its effect on the expression of metastatic and angiogenic genes by real time polymerase chain reaction. On silica gel column, we carried out initial fractionation analysis. RESULTS: LE exhibited time and dose dependent cytotoxicity on several tumor cells. Compared to cancer cells of colon, breast, lung and prostate origin, pancreatic cancer cells were significantly more sensitive to LE. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that LE selectively suppressed the transcription of metalloproteases (MMP-1 and -2), inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP-2) and angiogenic factors (VEGF-A and VEGF-B). Fractionation of LE on methanol equilibrated silica gel column resolved into three fractions of which fraction (F 3) was found to be enriched with anti-proliferative activity. CONCLUSION: Methanolic extract of Achyranthes aspera contains potent anti-proliferative compound with specific activity against pancreatic cancer.

In the whole cell patch clamp mode, Shilajit induced short-lived and repeatable inward currents under the condition of a high chloride pipette solution on all the SG neurons tested. The Shilajit-induced inward currents were concentration dependent and maintained in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a voltage gated Na(+) channel blocker, CNQX, a non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, and AP5, an NMDA receptor antagonist. The Shilajit-induced responses were partially suppressed by picrotoxin, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, and totally blocked in the presence of strychnine, a glycine receptor antagonist, however not affected by mecamylamine hydrochloride (MCH), a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Under the potassium gluconate pipette solution at holding potential 0 mV, Shilajit induced repeatable outward current. These results show that Shilajit has inhibitory effects on the SG neurons of Vc through chloride ion channels by activation of the glycine receptor and GABA(A) receptor, indicating that Shilajit contains sedating ingredients for the central nervous system.

Diabetes is currently the world\'s largest endocrine disorder, and estimates are that it affects almost 5% of the population. Ayurveda, the Indian traditional system of medicine, is one of the world\'s oldest systems to have documented the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. METHODS: Experimental studies performed in accordance with the modern medicine principles have shown that some of the medicinal plants and polyherbal preparations made using the plants used in Ayurveda are effective in preventing both hyperglycemia and its complications. Syzygium jambolanum (Syn Syzygium cumini, Eugenia cumini, Eugenia jambolana), commonly known as black plum and originally indigenous to India, is one of the important antidiabetic plants. RESULTS: Jamun has been used in various complementary and alternative systems of medicine and, before the discovery of insulin, was a frontline antidiabetic medication even in Europe. The brew prepared by boiling the Jamun seeds in boiling water has been used in the various traditional systems of medicine in India. CONCLUSIONS: This review includes the validated antidiabetic effects of Jamun and some of its compounds. Emphasis is also placed on addressing the various mechanisms of action contributing to the pharmacological effects and the aspects that need future investigations for Jamun to be of clinical use.','Mar-13','12/14/2014 19:27','12/14/2014 19:27','191-197','3','19','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23030429','','Diabetes Mellitus; Eugenia; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Phytotherapy; Plant Preparations');

Immobilization induced acute stress (AS; 3 days) and chronic stress (CS; 7 days) and swimming induced stress models were used to screen the anti-stress effect of the plant fractions and isolated flavanoids. The tested doses of EtAS and isolated flavanoids were able to produce significant effects in normalizing altered serum biochemical parameters and the severity of ulcer in both AS and CS models. Higher dose of EtAS, quercetin and kaempferol (25 mg/kg; po) were found to be significant in restoring the hypertrophy of adrenal gland and atrophy of spleen and thymus gland only in CS model. Greater swimming time was noted in the mice pretreated with tested doses of flavanoids and EtAS. In addition, levels of adrenal ascorbic acid and cortisol were restored compared to stress control group. EtAS exhibited significant scavenging effect of DPPH, hydroxyl radical and LPO. Thus, EtAS, quercetin and kaempferol are capable of increasing the capacity to tolerate non-specific stress in experimental animals, as evident from restoration of large number of parameters in the stress models studied. Bioactivity of EtAS may be due to the synergetic action of isolated flavanoids. Improvement in stress markers may be due its prolong effect of resistance to stress and partly due to free radical scavenging activity.','Jan-10','12/15/2014 3:03','12/15/2014 3:03','53-60','1','48','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20358867','','Acetates; Animals; Antioxidants; Convolvulaceae; Ethanol; Female; Flavonoids; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Kaempferols; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mice; Plant Extracts; Quercetin; Rats; Stress, Physiological');

This oxidative stress leads to Î²-cell destruction by apoptosis. Hence exploring agents modulating oxidative stress is an effective strategy in the treatment of both Type I and Type II diabetes. Plants are a major source of anti-oxidants and exert protective effects against oxidative stress in biological systems. Phyllanthus emblica, Curcuma longa and Tinospora cordifolia are three such plants widely used in Ayurveda for their anti-hyperglycemic activity. Additionally their anti-oxidant properties have been scientifically validated in various experimental in vitro and in vivo models. Hence the present in vitro study was planned to assess whether the anti-hyperglycemic effects of the hydro-alcoholic extracts of Phyllanthus emblica (Pe) and Curcuma longa (Cl) and aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia (Tc) are mediated through their antioxidant and/or anti-apoptotic property in a streptozotocin induced stress model. METHODS: RINm5F cell line was used as a model of pancreatic Î²-cells against stress induced by streptozotocin (2 mM). Non-toxic concentrations of the plant extracts were identified using MTT assay. Lipid peroxidation through MDA release, modulation of apoptosis and insulin release were the variables measured to assess streptozotocin induced damage and protection afforded by the plant extracts. RESULTS: All 3 plants extracts significantly inhibited MDA release from RIN cells indicating protective effect against STZ induced oxidative damage. They also exhibited a dose dependent anti-apoptotic effect as seen by a decrease in the sub G0 population in response to STZ.

The plant has a history of use in Ayurvedic medicine for over 2000 years as well as a wide variety of traditional applications. It is being evaluated for anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential because these phenomena have assumed a worldwide dimension as a result of their implications in a variety of diseases. METHODS: The methanol extract of the leaves of P. amarus was investigated for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities in Wistar strain albino rats and mice using carrageenan-induced inflammation as well as histamine-induced edema. The analgesic effect was determined using acetic acid writhing method and formalin-induced paw lick test. Standard phytochemical analysis was carried out to determine the active constituents responsible for biological effects. RESULTS: The extract at 100 and 200 mg/kg reduced significantly (p<0.05) the formation of edema induced by histamine and carrageenan. In the acetic acid-induced writhing test, the extract showed good analgesic activity characterized by a significant reduction in the number of writhes with 100 and 200 mg/kg doses used when compared to the control group. In the formalin-induced paw lick test, the extract at 100 and 200 mg/kg doses exhibited good analgesic activity characterized by a significant reduction in the number of paw licks at both the early and the late phases of the induced pain when compared with the untreated control group. Ibuprofen at 10 mg/kg served as the reference drug in all these tests. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggested that methanol extract of the leaves of P. amarus has great anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential. These biological effects exhibited by the extract of this plant may be attributed to the presence of flavonoids and other phenols contained therein.','1-May-14','12/14/2014 18:55','12/14/2014 18:55','175-180','2','25','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23893681','','');

In this study, eight species of Swertia were collected. Each of the dry whole plant was extracted into methanol, the aqueous extract of which was sequentially extracted into hexane, chloroform and butanol extracts. The extracts were screened for their anti-hepatotoxic activity against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and paracetamol (acetaminophen (AAP)) toxicity in primary monolayer cultures of rat hepatocytes. The primary cultures, 2.5 x 10(6) cells /3 ml medium/60 mm collagen-coated plates, were exposed to 2.5 mM CCl4 or 12 mM AAP in the presence or absence of plant extracts (100 microg/ml culture medium). Cells and medium were harvested after 22 h of treatment for the assay of cellular reduced gluthathione (GSH) content and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase as biological end-points of toxicity. Both CCl4 and AAP at the indicated concentrations reduced GSH by almost 50 and 80%, respectively, while the enzyme leakage was almost 15% above the untreated control. Hexane and methanol extracts of most of the species in general offered relatively good protection. The anti-hepatotoxic activity, nevertheless, was evident in all Swertia species against both the toxicants. However, Swertia purpurascens, Swertia chirata, Swertia paniculata and Swertia cordata exhibited better activity compared with other species investigated. In addition, influence of various extracts (10-100 microg/ml medium) was examined on cellular growth of rat Reuber hepatoma cell line H4IIEC3/G-. Except for the butanol extract of S. chirata, no other extracts exerted toxicity in terms of neutral red uptake by the cells.','May-01','12/15/2014 18:45','12/15/2014 18:45','239-247','3-Feb','75','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11297858','','Acetaminophen; Angiosperms; Animals; Carbon Tetrachloride; Cells, Cultured; Hepatocytes; In Vitro Techniques; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Male; Plant Extracts; Rats; Tumor Cells, Cultured');

Its aroma-active compounds were identified using gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) and aroma extraction dilution analysis (AEDA). In order to determine the relative contribution of each compound to the aroma of P. odorata, relative flavour activity (RFA) was calculated. The hydrodistillation of P. odorata afforded yellowish oil and the yield was 0.009% (w/w) with a spicy, sweet, and green odour. Eighty-five compounds were identified in the oil by GC-MS; the major constituents of the volatile oil were ageratochromene (11.95%), palmitic acid (9.95%), hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (5.96%), Î²-eudesmol (4.53%) and Î²-caryophyllene oxide (3.08%). The most characteristic aroma compounds in the volatile oil were identified for Î²-caryophyllene oxide (FD-factor = 128, spicy), (E)-pinocarveol (FD-factor = 64, sweet), 3-butylpyridine (FD-factor = 64, spicy), and 2-nonanone (FD-factor = 32, green) by GC-MS, GC-O and AEDA. It seems that these compounds are responsible for the spicy, sweet and green odour of the aerial parts of P. odorata. The antioxidant activity of the volatile oil was also investigated by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay using fluorescein (FL) as the fluorescent probe. The ORAC value of the oil was 594.2 Â± 25.9 Î¼M TE/g.

Following a glucose challenge of 2 gm/kg using oral gavage, a timed glucose tolerance test was used to determine the ability of these extracts to alter glucose levels in diabetic animal model. The glucose lowering activities of these extracts were then compared to the controls. Both tested herbal extracts have shown to exhibit significant (P < 0.05) hypoglycemic activity compared to the control. W. tinctoria and P. quinquefolia have an antidiabetic activity which reduced the blood glucose level in oral glucose tolerance test significantly compared with the control. To further understand their mechanism of action, blood insulin levels were also studied using an insulin Elisa assay. These studies revealed that the herbal extract of P. quinquefolia has direct correlation between glucose and insulin levels. However, W. tinctoria significantly lowered blood glucose levels (P< 0.05), while it did not show any correlation between blood glucose and insulin levels.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: WS root extract was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats during a period of 21 days pre-exposure and 07 days exposure to a simulated altitude of 25,000 ft. Spatial memory was assessed by Morris Water Maze. Neurodegeneration, corticosterone, acetylcholine (Ach) levels, acetylcholine esterase (AchE) activity, oxidative stress markers and nitric oxide (NO) concentration were assessed in the hippocampus. Synaptic and apoptotic markers were also investigated by immunoblotting. To study the role of NO in regulating corticosterone mediated signaling, the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (n-NOS) inhibitor, L-Nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-Name) and NO agonist sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were administered from 3rd to 7th day of hypoxic exposure. RESULTS: Administration of WS root extract prevented HH induced memory impairment and neurodegeneration along with decreased NO, corticosterone, oxidative stress and AchE activity in hippocampal region. Inhibition of NO synthesis by administration of L-Name reduced corticosterone levels in hippocampus during hypoxic exposure while co-administration of corticosterone increased neurodegeneration. Administration of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) along with WS root extract supplementation during hypoxic exposure increased corticosterone levels and increased the number of pyknotic cells.

The antioxidant effects have also been evaluated in comparison to the real levels of Vitamin C by different antioxidant tests. The data obtained show that the Emblica fruit contains ascorbic acid (0.4%, w/w), and that the Ayurvedic method of processing increases the healthy characteristics of the fruit thanks to a higher antioxidant activity and a higher content of ascorbic acid (1.28%, w/w).

These results appear to contradict the generally held notion that herbal remedies used in non-Western systems of botanical medicine have not been evaluated in human or in vivo trials. Some of these studies are not always as large or methodologically rigorous as clinical studies reported in major medical journals. Indeed, a critical assessment of the research according to the standards of evidence-based medicine would eliminate many of these studies for lack of rigor according to criteria of randomization, sample size, adequacy of controls, etc. However, the studies do suggest which species might be appropriate for larger and better-controlled trials in the future. Accordingly, a synopsis of the plants, their therapeutic applications, and their clinical or experimental evaluations is presented.','Oct-01','12/15/2014 18:45','12/15/2014 18:45','405-515','5','7','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11719942','','Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Materia Medica; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal');

Diabetes is one such illness and 80% of the diabetic population lives in the developing world. There is a rapidly growing trend towards the use of Complementary and Alternative Medical practices in Diabetes. Sri Lanka is a developing Asian nation with a rich culture of Ayurvedic and native medical culture. The objective of this study was to find the prevalence of use of CAMs in a diabetic population attending a large multiethnic diabetes facility in a University unit and to assess whether there is an increase in the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes among users of CAMs. METHODS: A cross sectional study was performed at Teaching Hospital Peradeniya between April and August 2012. Following verbal consent, 254 type 2 adult diabetic patients attending the diabetes facility were interviewed regarding the use of CAM and hypoglycaemia using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 252 valid results, 192 patients (76%) admitted to the use of a CAM to reduce blood glucose. Bitter gourd, ivy gourd and crepe ginger were used by 128, 113 and 92 individuals. While 19% used a single agent, 34%, 21% and 2.4% used 2,3 and more than 3 agents. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in CAM users was 21% and 16.6% in non-users. The difference was statistically not significant. (p = 0.57) Ingestion of Costus speciosus (Crepe ginger) was associated with higher incidence of hypoglycaemia (P = 0.01).Female gender was significantly associated with CAM use (p = 0.01), while the age, duration of diabetes, presence of co-morbidities and complications of diabetes failed to show a significant association. CONCLUSION: Sri Lanka has a very high use of herbal supplementation in type 2 diabetes patients. Although the overall incidence of hypoglycaemia is not increased among CAM users, crepe ginger is associated with significant hypoglycaemia and warrants further research.','2014','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','374','','14','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25280877','','');

This study investigated the hepatoprotective activity of PNK to validate the traditional use of this formulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PNK was prepared in the laboratory according to the method given in Ayurvedic literature. Phytochemical screening was performed to determine the presence of phytoconstituents. Hepatoprotective activity was evaluated against CCl(4)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats and by its effect on the HepG2 cell line. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the presence of alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, and a bitter principle in PNK. Administration of PNK produced significant hepatoprotective effect as demonstrated by decreased levels of serum liver marker enzymes such as aspartate transaminase, serum alanine transaminase, serum alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin and an increase in protein level. Thiopentone-induced sleeping time was also decreased in the PNK-treated animals compared with the CCl(4)-treated group. It also showed antioxidant activity by increase in activity of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase and by a decrease in thiobarbituric acid reactive substance level compared with the CCl(4)-treated group. Results of a histopathological study also support the hepatoprotective activity of PNK. Investigation carried out on the HepG2 cell line depicted significant increase in viability of cells exposed to PNK as compared with CCl(4)-treated cells. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that PNK protects hepatocytes from CCl(4)-induced liver damages due to its antioxidant effect on hepatocytes. An in vitro study on HepG2 cell lines also supports its protective effect.','Apr-11','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','408-415','4','49','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21391842','','Alanine Transaminase; Animals; Antioxidants; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Carbon Tetrachloride; Cytoprotection; Drug-Induced Liver Injury; Female; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Liver; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mice; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Silymarin');

The present investigation reports on immunomodulatory efficacy of aqueous-ethanol extracts of roots of three selected Withania somnifera chemotypes designated as NMITLI 101R, NMITLI 118R and NMITLI 128R. Each chemotype was administered 10-100 mg/kg orally to BALB/c mice once daily for 14 days. The immunomodulatory consequences were recorded by determining the humoral immune response with the help of hemagglutination, plaque forming cell assay and cellular response by measuring delayed type hypersensitivity reaction. Additionally, other immune parameters such as proliferation of T and B cells, intracellular and secreted Th1 and Th2 cytokines along with modulation in ROS production by peritoneal macrophages were monitored after feeding with lower doses (3-30 mg/kg/day) of these three chemotypes individually. NMITLI 101R incited both humoral and cellular immune response in terms of higher number of antibody producing cells and enhanced foot pad swelling at the 10mg dose as also dose dependent B and T cell proliferations. Levels of intracellular and secreted cytokines post-NMITLI 101R treatment illustrated generation of mixed Th1/Th2 response that remained more polarized towards Th1. This chemotype also generated maximum reactive oxygen species. NMITLI 118R provoked comparatively reduced immune response in all humoral and cellular parameters at lower doses but induced highly polarized Th1 cytokine response. In contrast, NMITLI 128R led to enhanced antibody production with minimal cellular response demonstrating marginally Th2 dominance at a lower dose. Taken together, it may therefore be concluded that there were distinct modulation in the immune response exhibited by the three chemotypes of Withania somnifera and NMITLI 101R appeared to possess a better immunostimulatory activity than the other chemotypes at lower doses.','1-Feb-12','12/15/2014 2:38','12/15/2014 2:38','1083-1093','6','30','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22182427','','Adjuvants, Immunologic; Animals; Antibody Formation; Erythrocytes; Female; Immunity, Cellular; India; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Plant Extracts; Sheep; Withania');

The scarcity of adequate illustrations was more than compensated in the Renaissance, when the efforts of both artists and anatomists for the first time produced basically correct renditions of the human nervous system and many other bodily structures. As attention was next focused on microscopic structure as a requisite to understand physiological mechanisms, during the Enlightenment the nerves were revealed to consist of numerous thin tubes or fibers aligned in parallel. Improved microscopy techniques in the nineteenth century led to discovering and delineating still finer fibrils coursing along the cores of the nerve fibers themselves. Electron microscopy, developed throughout the twentieth century, recognized some of these fibrils within nerve fibers as being also tubular.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicines in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following electronic databases till July 2004: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, LILACS, the Chinese Biomedical Database, combined with hand searches of Chinese journals and conference proceedings till end of 2003. No language restriction was used. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of herbal medicines compared with no treatment, placebo, pharmacological interventions were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two authors. The methodological quality of trials was evaluated using the components of randomisation, allocation concealment, double blinding, and inclusion of randomised participants. MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-five randomised trials, involving 7957 participants with irritable bowel syndrome, met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was high, but the quality of remaining trials was generally low. Seventy-one different herbal medicines were tested in the included trials, in which herbal medicines were compared with placebo or conventional pharmacologic therapy. Herbal medicines were also combined with conventional therapy and compared to conventional therapy alone.Compared with placebo, a Standard Chinese herbal formula, individualised Chinese herbal medicine, STW 5 and STW 5-II, Tibetan herbal medicine Padma Lax, traditional Chinese formula Tongxie Yaofang, and Ayurvedic preparation showed significantly improvement of global symptoms. Compared with conventional therapy in 65 trials testing 51 different herbal medicines, 22 herbal medicines demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for symptom improvement, and 29 herbal medicines were not significantly different than conventional therapy. In nine trials that evaluated herbal medicine combined with conventional therapy, six tested herbal preparations showed additional benefit from the combination therapy compared with conventional monotherapy. No serious adverse events from the herbal medicines were reported. AUTHORS\' CONCLUSIONS: Some herbal medicines may improve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: LPEG and LPEE were prepared separately by using 50% ethanol following the standard procedures. A graded dose (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg) response study for both LPEE and LPGE was carried out for analgesic activity against rat tail flick response which indicated 500 mg/kg as the optimal effective analgesic dose. Hence, 500 mg/kg dose of LPEE and LPGE was used for hot plate test and acetic acid induced writhing model in analgesic activity and for evaluation of hypnotic activity. RESULTS: Both the extracts did not produce any acute toxicity in mice at single oral dose of 2.0 g/kg.

Further, BSAE (30 Î¼g dwt/mL) and BSWE (300 Î¼g dwt/mL) attenuated â‰¥ 60% of H(2)O(2) mediated ROS generation in THP-1 cells. In case of standard compounds, ascorbate (20 Î¼g dwt/mL) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (10 Î¼g dwt/mL) completely scavenged ROS in the cells. BSAE and BSWE at 3 mg dwt/mL completely inhibited ADP induced platelet aggregation and activities were comparable to 20 Î¼g/mL of heparin. The extracts also showed very high activity in prolonging coagulation time periods. Both types of extracts extended prothrombin time (PT) from âˆ¼13 to >60s and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) from âˆ¼32s to >90s. BSAE inhibited clotting factors Xa and XIa remarkably at 6 Î¼g of dwt where as BSWE did not show much effect on FXa and showed 30% inhibition on FXIa at 120 Î¼g. 10 Î¼g of heparin was required to inhibit about 30% activity of the above factors. HPLC analyses suggested that BSAE and BSWE had AKÎ²BA of 9% (w/w) and 7.8% (w/w) respectively. CONCLUSION: Present study demonstrated antioxidant and antithrombotic anticoagulant activities of water and hydroalcoholic extracts of Boswellia serrata\'s gum resin. We suggest that BS-gum resin as a good source for lead/therapeutic compounds possessing antioxidant, antiplatelet and anticoagulant activities.','1-Sep-11','12/15/2014 2:38','12/15/2014 2:38','893-901','1','137','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21771654','','Animals; Anticoagulants; Antioxidants; Blood Coagulation; Blood Coagulation Tests; Boswellia; Cell Line; Chlorides; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Ethanol; Ferric Compounds; Humans; Lipid Peroxidation; Liver; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Microscopy, Confocal; Monocytes; Myocytes, Cardiac; Oxidative Stress; Plant Bark; Plant Gums; Plants, Medicinal; Platelet Aggregation; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Platelet Function Tests; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Reactive Oxygen Species; Resins, Plant; Solvents; Time Factors; Water');

Fumigation therapy is one of the several treatment methods described in Ayurveda whereby fumes produced from defined drug formulations are inhaled by patients. This therapeutic procedure offers promising research opportunities from phytochemical and ethnopharmacological viewpoints, however, it remains under-noticed. Considering these facts, this review is primarily aimed at introducing said Ayurvedic fumigation therapy and discussing its scientific gaps and future challenges. METHODOLOGY: A search of multiple bibliographical databases and traditional Ayurvedic text books was conducted and the articles analyzed under various key themes, e.g., Ayurvedic fumigation, fumigation therapy, medicinal fumigation, inhalation of drugs and aerosol therapy. RESULT: Ayurveda recommends fumigation as a method of sterilization and therapeutic procedure for various human diseases including microbial infections and psychological disorders. However, it has not gained much attention as a prospective field with multiple research opportunities.

Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a challenging condition for health care systems worldwide. Only limited trial data is available for FMS for outcomes of complex treatment interventions of complementary and integrative (CIM) approaches. Methods. We conducted a controlled, nonrandomized feasibility study that compared outcomes in 21 patients treated with Ayurveda with those of 11 patients treated with a conventional approach at the end of a two-week inpatient hospital stay. Primary outcome was the impact of fibromyalgia on patients as assessed by the FIQ. Secondary outcomes included scores of pain intensity, pain perception, depression, anxiety, and quality of sleep. Follow-up assessments were done after 6 months. Results. At 2 weeks, there were comparable and significant improvements in the FIQ and for most of secondary outcomes in both groups with no significant in-between-group differences. The beneficial effects for both treatment groups were partly maintained for the main outcome and a number of secondary outcomes at the 6-month followup, again with no significant in-between-group differences. Discussion. The findings of this feasibility study suggest that Ayurvedic therapy is noninferior to conventional treatment in patients with severe FMS. Since Ayurveda was only used as add-on treatment, RCTs on Ayurveda alone are warranted to increase model validity.

Therefore, it is very important to analyze and evaluate the compatibility of various active constituents and markers from different medicinal plants for their possible chemical interactions with various excipients at different storage conditions during the development of a stable polyherbal formulation. OBJECTIVE: To study chemical stability of kalmegh (Andrographis paniculata) and kutki (Picrorhiza kurroa) extract for their active markers andrographolide, kutkoside and picroside-I and to develop stable polyherbal formulation based on the incompatibility studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The compatibility study was carried out on individual ethanolic extracts of these two plants along with the commonly used excipients in the ratio of 1:1 at 40 Â± 2Â°C and 75 Â± 5% relative humidity and at a refrigeration temperature of 5 Â± 1Â°C for initial, 7-, 15- and 30-day intervals. The analysis was carried out using the validated reverse phase-high-performance liquid chromatography methods. A stable tablet dosage form was developed based on the results of these studies. RESULT: The study suggested that the active markers of kutki (kutkoside and picroside-I) were found to be degraded in the presence of the kalmegh extract. However, the active marker of the kalmegh extract (andrographolide) was found to be stable. Both the extracts showed excellent compatibility with all the excipients used in making this formulation. No significant decrease in the kutkoside and picroside-I content from the formulation was observed. CONCLUSION: By separate granulation process the exposure of both the extracts can be minimized thus avoiding the degradation of active markers.','Apr-11','12/15/2014 2:38','12/15/2014 2:38','122-129','2','3','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21772756','','');

The large number of phenotype description by prakriti determination is based on the knowledge and experience of the assessor, and hence subject to inherent variations and interpretations. OBJECTIVE: In this study we have attempted to relate dominant prakriti attribute to body mass index (BMI) of individuals by assessing an acceptable tool to provide the quantitative measure to the currently qualitative ayurvedic prakriti determination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study is cross sectional, multicentered, and prakriti assessment of a total of 3416 subjects was undertaken. Healthy male, nonsmoking, nonalcoholic volunteers between the age group of 20-30 were screened for their prakriti after obtaining written consent to participate in the study. The prakriti was determined on the phenotype description of ayurvedic texts and simultaneously by the use of a computer-aided prakriti assessment tool. Kappa statistical analysis was employed to validate the prakriti assessment and Chi-square, Cramer\'s V test to determine the relatedness in the dominant prakriti to various attributes. RESULTS: We found 80% concordance between ayurvedic physician and software in predicting the prakriti of an individual. The kappa value of 0.77 showed moderate agreement in prakriti assessment. We observed a significant correlations of dominant prakriti to place of birth and BMI with Chi-square, P < 0.01 (Cramer\'s V-value of 0.156 and 0.368, respectively). CONCLUSION: The present study attempts to integrate knowledge of traditional ayurvedic concepts with the contemporary science. We have demonstrated analysis of prakriti classification and its association with BMI and place of birth with the implications to one of the ways for human classification.','Jul-14','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','167-175','3','5','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25336848','','');

RESULTS: Fifty-four per cent (40/74) of the IMPs saw two to five TB patients every month. Sixty-one per cent (46/74) reported that they based their diagnosis of TB on symptoms alone, whereas 38% use diagnostic tests such as chest X-ray, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and sputum examination. Forty per cent of the IMPs reported that alcohol was the cause of TB, 36.5% cited smoking and 17.6% reported infection as the cause. Only 34% (25/74) of IMPs reported that they treated TB patients, while the rest said that they referred such cases to nearby hospitals. Anti-tuberculosis drugs used by IMPs were isoniazid, rifampicin and streptomycin, but none of them knew the dosage of the drugs, the duration of treatment or the correct regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydroalcoholic extract was prepared from the above samples and was tested for total reducing power and in vitro antioxidant activity by ABTS(+) assay, Superoxide anion scavenging activity assay and lipid per-oxidation assay. RESULT: Reducing power shows dose depended increase in concentration maximum absorption of 0.677 Â± 0.017 at 1000 Î¼g/ml compared with standard Quercetin 0.856Â±0.020. ABTS(+) assay shows maximum inhibition of 64.2 Â± 0.86 with EC50 675.31 Â± 4.24. Superoxide free radical shows maximum scavenging activity of 62.45 Â± 1.86 with EC50 774.70 Â± 5.45.

The result suggests polyherbal formulation to be a good potential for antioxidant activity. Oxidative stress results from imbalance between free radical-generation and radical scavenging systems. This will lead to tissue damage and oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we strongly suggest that Polyherbal compounds are source of potential antioxidant for radical scavenging. The highly positive correlation of antiradical scavenging activity and total polyphenolic content in Polyherbal compounds indicates that polyphenols are important components which could be used for the free radical scavenging activity.

However intense the therapy may be, HIV virus is rarely eliminated, and drug resistance is a major setback during long-term therapy. The development of new drugs and strategies and exploring alternative systems of medicine for antiviral herbs or drugs is the need of the age to improve treatment outcomes. Ayurveda describes many diseases which incorporate HIV like illness e.g. Rajayakshma, Ojo Kshaya, Sannipata jwara etc. HIV infection affects multisystems, chiefly the Immune System which can be correlated to Ojo Kshaya. Rasayana Chikitsa is the frontline therapy employed to treat Ojus disorders. Therefore Shilajatu (Mineral pitch), Centella asiatica (Mandukaparni), Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) and Emblica officinalis (Amalaki), well known for their Immuno-modulator and antioxidant properties were selected to evaluate their role on immune system.

However, development of existing systems has been hindered by the unavailability of up-to-date information on medicinal materials and other related issues. For streamlining purposes, we investigated the present-day scenario of country×³s medicinal plant industry by gathering up-to-date information on the types of raw materials required, their aggregate quantities, heavily used and rare materials, family wise distribution, challenges faced by stakeholders as well as other pertinent issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present survey covered the selected government Ayurveda hospitals, traditional and Ayurveda practitioners, large and small-scale herbal drug and cosmetic manufactures, importers, collectors and Ayurveda commissioners throughout the country. A systematic questionnaire was distributed and face-to-face interviews were conducted. Collected data were tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS: A diverse range of medicinal materials, including 290 species (64.73%) from dried plants, 59 (13.17%) from fresh plants, 69 (15.40%) from minerals, 18 (4.02%) from animal sources and 12 (2.68%) from other sources were recorded. A total of 302 plant species belonging to 95 families, dominated by Leguminosae family, was listed. Out of these, 46 species belonging to 35 families were used intensively. A large portion of herbal materials was of completely local origin (71.13%) while 26% were imported and the rest (2.87%) can be obtained by both routes. Leaves were the most highly used part of the plant (22.2%). High price, poor quality, insufficient or totally absence of continuous supply and adulteration were the main constraints faced by the stakeholders. The unavailability of systematic cultivation and processing protocols, incorrect identification, and lack of proper quality control methodologies were identified as major challenges of the industry. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed a currently bleak scenario of the medicinal material industry in Sri Lanka. The results clearly demonstrated the need to implement a national strategy to address the major challenges faced by different stakeholders.

In this situation, use of radioprotective compounds that can protect normal tissues against radiation injury are of immense use. In addition to protecting normal tissue these compounds will also permit use of higher radiation doses to obtain better cancer control and possible cure. However, to date, no ideal radioprotectors are available as most synthetic compounds are toxic at their optimal concentrations and have produced little success in clinics. Radiation ill-effects are principally the result of generation of free radicals, and the antioxidant compounds that counter them are supposed to be of immense use in preventing them. In Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine, several plants have been observed to avert/ameliorate free radical-mediated ailments--an effect that has been documented--and such plants have recently been the focus of attention. Aegle marmelos (L.) Correa (Bael), commonly known as bael, has been used since antiquity for treating various ailments, some of which are now known to be the result of oxidative stress. In studies spanning nearly a decade, it has been observed that bael prevented radiation-induced ill-effects, and the results of these studies indicate that it has the potential to be an effective, nontoxic radioprotective agent. In this current review, for the first time, an attempt is made to summarize these observations and to discuss the plausible reasons responsible for bael\'s radioprotective effects.','Oct-10','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','1109-1116','10','16','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20932194','','Aegle; Humans; Neoplasms; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Radiation, Ionizing; Radiation-Protective Agents; Radiation Tolerance');

Ulcer infection impairs healing and antimicrobial interventions may cure infection, aid healing and reduce amputation rates. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the evidence for antimicrobial interventions for foot ulcers in diabetes. METHODS: We searched 16 databases, 11 Internet sites, three books, conference proceedings, a journal and bibliographies in November 2002. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs). RESULTS: Twenty-three studies investigated the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial agents: intravenous antibiotics (n = 8); oral antibiotics (n = 5); topical antimicrobials (n = 4); subcutaneous granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (n = 4); Ayurvedic preparations (n = 1): and sugar vs. antibiotics vs. standard care (n = 1). The trials were small and too dissimilar to be pooled. There is no strong evidence for any particular antimicrobial agent for the prevention of amputation, resolution of infection, or ulcer healing. Pexiganan cream may be as effective as oral ofloxacin for resolution of infection. Ampicillin and sulbactam cost less than imipenem/cilastatin, G-CSF cost less than standard care and cadexomer iodine dressings may cost less than daily dressings.

Approximately 30%-40% of patients with major depression have only a partial response to available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been used either alone or in combination with conventional therapies in patients with mood disorders. This review of the literature examines evidence-based data on the use of CAM in mood disorders. A search of the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Quertile databases using keywords was conducted, and relevant articles published in the English language in the peer-reviewed journals over the past two decades were retrieved. Evidence-based data suggest that light therapy, St John\'s wort, Rhodiola rosea, omega-3 fatty acids, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness therapies, exercise, sleep deprivation, and S-adenosylmethionine are effective in the treatment of mood disorders. Clinical trials of vitamin B complex, vitamin D, and methylfolate found that, while these were useful in physical illness, results were equivocal in patients with mood disorders. Studies support the adjunctive role of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid in unipolar and bipolar depression, although manic symptoms are not affected and higher doses are required in patients with resistant bipolar depression and rapid cycling. Omega-3 fatty acids are useful in pregnant women with major depression, and have no adverse effects on the fetus. Choline, inositol, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, and N-acetylcysteine are effective adjuncts in bipolar patients. Dehydroepiandrosterone is effective both in bipolar depression and depression in the setting of comorbid physical disease, although doses should be titrated to avoid adverse effects. Ayurvedic and homeopathic therapies have the potential to improve symptoms of depression, although larger controlled trials are needed. Mind-body-spirit and integrative medicine approaches can be used effectively in mild to moderate depression and in treatment-resistant depression. Currently, although CAM therapies are not the primary treatment of mood disorders, level 1 evidence could emerge in the future showing that such treatments are effective.','2013','12/14/2014 19:14','12/14/2014 19:14','639-658','','9','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23700366','','');

Enhancement of the central cholinergic function by the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase is a prominent clinically effective approach for the treatment of AD. Recently withanolide A, a secondary metabolite from the ayurvedic plant Withania somnifera has shown substantial neuro-protective ability.

The study provides evidence for consideration of withanolide A as a valuable small ligand molecule in treatment and prevention of AD associated pathology.

Earlier diagnosis increases survival rate in patients. However, treatments for advanced disease are limited to hormone ablation techniques and palliative care. Thus, new methods of treatment and prevention are necessary for inhibiting disease progression to a hormone refractory state. One of the approaches to control prostate cancer is prevention through diet, which inhibits one or more neoplastic events and reduces the cancer risk. For centuries, Ayurveda has recommended the use of bitter melon (Momordica charantia) as a functional food to prevent and treat human health related issues. In this study, we have initially used human prostate cancer cells, PC3 and LNCaP, as an in vitro model to assess the efficacy of bitter melon extract (BME) as an anticancer agent. We observed that prostate cancer cells treated with BME accumulate during the S phase of the cell cycle and modulate cyclin D1, cyclin E, and p21 expression. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with BME enhanced Bax expression and induced PARP cleavage. Oral gavage of BME, as a dietary compound, delayed the progression to high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate) mice (31%). Prostate tissue from BME-fed mice displayed approximately 51% reduction of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression. Together, our results suggest for the first time that oral administration of BME inhibits prostate cancer progression in TRAMP mice by interfering cell-cycle progression and proliferation.','Dec-11','12/15/2014 2:38','12/15/2014 2:38','2122-2130','12','4','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21911444','','Administration, Oral; Animals; Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Cell Cycle; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Progression; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Momordica charantia; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Prostate; Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia; Prostatic Neoplasms; Tumor Cells, Cultured');

In case of sildenafil and tadalafil, adulteration was also detected by comparing the relative retention times (RR(T)) and UV spectra. Further substantiation was done through comparison of accurate mass spectra with those of the two available standards.

The striking similarities between psychologic somatotypes and Indian medicine body types permits proposal of a finite genopsycho-somatotyping of humans. Genopsycho-somatotyping of humans consists of a set of common physiologic, physical, and psychologic attributes related to a common basic birth constitution that remains somewhat permanent during human lifetime, since it is proposed that this birth constitution is programmed in the person\'s DNA (genes). This mainly provides a tool for classifying the human population based on broad and finite phenotype clusters across different ethnicity, languages, geographical location, or self-reported ancestry. In spite of any social or environmental traumatic event, I propose for males that every basic constitution has an associated identification organ, a measured property or marker, a soma, and some psyche general tendencies suggesting specific behavior or recurrent conduct. Three (3) basic extreme genopsycho-somatotypes or birth constitutions are enunciated: mesomorphic or andrus (Pitta), endomorphic or thymus (Khapa), and ectomorphic or thyrus (Vata). The method further predicts that male andrus constitution across races shares similarities in androgen (An) nuclear receptor behavior, whereas thymus constitutions are mainly regulated by T-cells (Tc) nuclear receptor behavior. Moreover, it suggests that thyrus constitutions share similarities in thyroxine (Th) nuclear receptor behavior. These proposed nuclear receptors are expected to regulate the expression of specific genes, thereby controlling the embryonic development, adult homeostasis, and metabolism of the human organism in a very profound way. The method finally predicts small differences in measured property (An, Tc, and Th nuclear receptors behavior) within a birth constitution across different races to be expected by modulation effects in melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor behavior.','May-11','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','465-468','5','17','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21563964','','Behavior; Body Constitution; Continental Population Groups; DNA; Gene Expression Regulation; Genomics; Genotype; Hormones; Humans; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Personality; Phenotype; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Receptors, Pituitary Hormone; Somatotypes; Thyroxine; T-Lymphocytes');

It has been used by the Ayurvedic practitioners since time immemorial for diseases ranging from weakness of memory to being used as an anthelminthic. Reports of its use have been found in books like Charak Samhita, Sushruta Samhita, etc., The major constituent of the oil of Vacha is a phenyl propanoid called Î²-asarone, which is reported to show carcinogenic properties. Due to the toxic effects of Î²-asarone, sodhana prakriya (detoxification process) has been prescribed for Vacha before its inclusion in the Ayurvedic medicines. Shodhanaprakriya (S. prakriya) of Vacha has been mentioned in the Ayurvedic texts. OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken with an aim to find out the mechanism involved in the S. prakriya of Vacha and also to suggest an alternate method for the conventional one. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The conventional method was studied in the laboratory and equivalent alternate methods were designed based on the mechanism involved.

Oral administration of \'Ilogen-Excel\' (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) for 60 days resulted in significantly lowered levels of blood glucose and significantly increased levels of plasma insulin, hepatic glycogen and total hemoglobin. \'Ilogen-Excel\' administration also decreased the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, hydroperoxides, ceruloplasmin and vitamin E in diabetic rats. Plasma reduced glutathione and vitamin C were significantly elevated by oral administration of \'Ilogen-Excel\'. Administration of insulin normalized all the biochemical parameters studied in diabetic rats. The effect at a dose of 100 mg/kg was more pronounced than 50 mg/kg and brought back all the parameters to near normal levels.

Ayurveda recommends the use of Abrus seeds after the Shodhana process (detoxification). OBJECTIVE: The current study was aimed at performing the Shodhana process, swedana (boiling) of Abrus precatorius seeds using water as a medium and to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of seed extract post detoxification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-detoxified and detoxified extracts were prepared and subsequently subjected to various in vitro and in vivo assays. In hemagglutination assay, the non-detoxified extract shows higher agglutination of RBCs than detoxified extract indicating riddance of toxic hemagglutinating proteins by Shodhana. This was confirmed by the SDSPAGE analysis of detoxified extract revealing the absence of abrin band in detoxified extract when compared to non-detoxified extract. RESULTS: The cytotoxicity assay in HeLa cell line expresses a higher reduction in growth percentage of the cells with non-detoxified extract as compared to detoxified extract indicating successful detoxification. Brine shrimp lethality test indicated the reduction in toxicity index of detoxified extract as compared to non-detoxified extract. Further, the whole body apoptosis assay in zebrafish revealed that percentage of viable cells were greater for detoxified extract than non-detoxified extract. The anti-inflammatory studies using carrageenan induced paw edema model in rats was carried out on the extracts with doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, per oral, where the detoxified extract exhibited significant inhibition of rat paw edema at both the doses comparable to that of Diclofenac sodium. CONCLUSION: Absence of toxicity and the retention of the anti-inflammatory activity of detoxified Abrus seed extract confirmed that the Swedana process is effective in carrying out the detoxification without affecting its therapeutic potential.','Jul-14','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','154-161','3','5','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25336846','','');

Diabetes and obesity have a multi-factorial basis involving both genetic and environmental risk factors. A wide array of medicinal plants and their active constituents play a role in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Salacia roots have been used in Ayurvedic medicine for diabetes and obesity since antiquity, and have been extensively consumed in Japan, the United States and other countries as a food supplement for the prevention of obesity and diabetes. Recent pharmacological studies have demonstrated that Salacia roots modulate multiple targets: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha-mediated lipogenic gene transcription, angiotensin II/angiotensin II type 1 receptor, alpha-glucosidase, aldose reductase and pancreatic lipase. These multi-target actions may mainly contribute to Salacia root-induced improvement of type 2 diabetes and obesity-associated hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and related cardiovascular complications seen in humans and rodents. The results of bioassay-guided identification indicate that mangiferin, salacinol, kotalanol and kotalagenin 16-acetate are at least in part responsible for these multi-target regulatory activities of Salacia roots. The evidence suggests that this unique traditional medicine fulfills a multiple-target strategy in the prevention and treatment of diabetes and obesity. Although toxicological studies have suggested minimal adverse effects of the herbal medicine in rodents, a clinical trial is crucial to further confirm the safety of Salacia roots. In addition, further mechanistic studies are necessary in order to allow a better understanding of how use of Salacia root may interact with other therapeutic interventions.','23-May-08','12/15/2014 17:55','12/15/2014 17:55','1045-1049','21-22','82','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18433791','','Aldehyde Reductase; alpha-Glucosidases; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus; Fatty Acids; Humans; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Myocardium; Obesity; Pancrelipase; Phytotherapy; Plant Roots; PPAR alpha; Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1; Salacia; Signal Transduction');

RESULTS: Whereas 130 randomized controlled trials were found with patients outside of palliative care settings, only 10Â controlled studies with patients in end-of-life situations were identified: three RCTs with methylnaltrexone and one with the combination of oxycodone and naloxone showed the effect and safety of opiate antagonists for patients who are not at risk of gastrointestinal perforation. There have been no studies which test methylnaltrexone against the optimization of therapy with conventional laxatives. Six other controlled studies of limited quality in design and execution and with only few participants tested naloxone, senna, lactulose, Co-danthramer, an Ayurvedic preparation (Misrakasneham), magnesium hydroxide, fluid paraffin, sodium picosulfate and docusate without finding statistically significant differences in efficacy or side effects. Most patients in these studies had cancer. Only case studies with few patients in palliative care were found for meglumine, neostigmine, and other substances mentioned above. CONCLUSION: Evidence on medical treatment of constipation in palliative care is sparse and guidelines have to refer to evidence from outside the palliative care setting and to expert opinions. Results from studies with other patient groups can only be transferred with limitations to very ill patients at the end of life who might have a higher risk for potential side effects such as gastrointestinal perforation in case of abdominal tumor manifestation. Therefore further studies are required to evaluate the medical treatment of multiple reasons for constipation in these patients. These studies should focus on feasibility, clinical relevance and quality of life.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiangiogenic activity of the PHF was evaluated using in ovo chick chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) assay and in vivo cautery induced corneal neovascularization assay in rats. Anticataract potential was evaluated using steroid induced cataract in developing chick embryos, sodium selenite induced cataract in rat pups and galactose induced cataract in rats. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using di-phenyl picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in vitro using inhibition of LTB4 formation in human WBCs and in vivo using carrageenan induced paw edema assay in rats. The cytotoxicity was evaluated against HeLa cancer cell lines using (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Furthermore evaluation of the intraocular penetration of the PHF was carried out in rabbit eyes via aqueous humor paracentesis and further analysis using LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: PHF significantly inhibited VEGF induced proliferation of new blood vessels in CAM assay and inhibited the cautery induced corneal neovascularization in rats. Additionally, PHF showed noticeable delay in the progression of cataract in the selenite and galactose induced cataract models whereby the PHF treated lenses were graded for stages II and III respectively. However, the PHF did not show any anticataract activity in the hydrocortisone induced cataract model. Moreover, PHF exhibited anti-inflammatory activity whereby it showed 39.34% inhibition of LTB4 formation and significantly inhibited carrageenan induced paw edema in rats. Eight compounds of PHF viz. camphor, casticin, curcumin-II, quercetin, rosmarinic acid, Î³-terpinene, Î²-pinene and dipentene exhibited transcorneal penetration in rabbit eyes.

BSE depressed electrically-, acetylcholine-, and barium chloride-induced contractions in the isolated guinea-pig ileum, being more potent in inhibiting the contractions induced by acetylcholine and barium chloride. The inhibitory effect of BSE on acetylcholine-induced contractions was reduced by the L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers verapamil and nifedipine, but not by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid, by the phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor rolipram or by the lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton. 3-acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid, one of the main active ingredients of B. serrata, inhibited acetylcholine-induced contractions. BSE inhibited upper gastrointestinal transit in croton oil-treated mice as well as castor oil-induced diarrhoea. However, BSE did not affect intestinal motility in control mice, both in the small and in the large intestine. It is concluded that BSE directly inhibits intestinal motility with a mechanism involving L-type Ca(2+) channels. BSE prevents diarrhoea and normalizes intestinal motility in pathophysiological states without slowing the rate of transit in control animals.

Patients currently presenting for treatment of mental disorder may describe their illness with reference to these concepts, but they also rely on other indigenous traditional concepts such as astrology, karma, the effects of other humoral relationships, such as semen loss and so forth; or they may rely on ideas derived from cosmopolitan medicine or both. Patients presenting to allopathic psychiatric centers in India were studied to determine whether patterns of help seeking could be predicted from the conceptual model by which they understood their illness. We elicited explanatory models from patients and obtained a history of prior consultations to other types of healer. Preliminary findings were notable for the pervasiveness of prior use of folk healers and the prominence of somatic symptoms among patients presenting to these allopathic physicians.

Very low doses, on the other hand, may have no therapeutic value. In this paper we report the chemical standardisation of Kutajarista by HPLC analysis based upon the presence of the biomarker conessine in the formulation. The standardisation method is simple and reliable, and the precision of method has been tested for repeatability (n = 3) and reproducibility (n = 9). The response of a refractive index detector was linear in the concentration range of 0.1-1.0 mg/mL. Recovery studies were performed to check the method for accuracy.

Guggulsterone isolated from guggul has been identified as the bioactive constituent responsible for guggul\'s therapeutic effects. Since the first study demonstrating the therapeutic effects of guggul in an animal model in 1966, numerous preclinical and clinical trails have been carried out. Although differences in study design, methodological quality, statistical analysis, sample size, and subject population result in certain inconsistencies in the response to therapy, the cumulative data from in vitro, preclinical, and clinical studies largely support the therapeutic claims for guggul described in the ancient Ayurvedic text. However, future clinical studies with much larger size and longer term are required to confirm these claims. The cardiovascular benefits of the therapy are derived from the multiple pharmacological activities associated with guggul or guggulsterone, notably its hypolipidemic, antioxidant, and antiinflammatory activities. It has been established that guggulsterone is an antagonist at farnesoid x receptor (FXR), a key transcriptional regulator for the maintenance of cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis. The FXR antagonism by guggulsterone has been proposed as a mechanism for its hypolipidemic effect. A recent study demonstrates that guggulsterone upregulates the bile salt export pump (BSEP), an efflux transporter responsible for removal of cholesterol metabolites, bile acids from the liver. Such upregulation of BSEP expression by guggulsterone favors cholesterol metabolism into bile acids, and thus represents another possible mechanism for its hypolipidemic activity. Guggulsterone has been found to potently inhibit the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), a critical regulator of inflammatory responses. Such repression of NF-kappaB activation by guggulsterone has been proposed as a mechanism of the antiinflammatory effect of guggulsterone.','2007','12/15/2014 17:55','12/15/2014 17:55','375-390','4','25','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18078436','','Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Clinical Trials as Topic; Commiphora; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Humans; NF-kappa B; Plant Extracts; Pregnenediones; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Transcription Factors');

The AEC stimulated insulin secretion from mouse pancreatic tissues under both basal and hyperglycaemic conditions, although the maximum effect was only 68% of that of tolbutamide. The AEC induced stepwise stimulation of glucose uptake from abdominal muscle tissues in the presence and absence of insulin, and the combination of AEC and insulin significantly potentiated the glucose uptake into abdominal muscle tissue. However, this effect was attenuated by wortmannin, suggesting that AEC possibly acts via the insulin-mediated glucose uptake pathway.

Previous CAM diabetes research has generally focused on single modalities, but CAM practitioners more commonly prescribe complex, multimodality interventions. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine the feasibility and clinical impact of a whole-system, Ayurvedic intervention for newly diagnosed people with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Patients were randomly assigned to either an experimental or control arm. SETTING: Group model health maintenance organization. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 60 adult patients with baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values between 6.0 and 8.0. INTERVENTION: Treatment for the experimental group included exercise, an Ayurvedic diet, meditation instruction, and an Ayurvedic herb supplement (MA 471). Control patients attended standard diabetes education classes with primary care clinician follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months and included HbA1c, fasting glucose, lipids, blood pressure, and weight. RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of randomized patients completed the study, and there were no significant adverse study-related events. Using analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA), we found no significant differences for clinical outcomes at 6 months between on-study patient groups, though trends favored the Ayurvedic group. When we included a factor measuring how much baseline HbA1c exceeded the mean (6.5%), however, we found statistically significant improvements in the Ayurvedic group for HbA1c (P = .006), fasting glucose (P = .001), total cholesterol (P = .05), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P = .04), and weight (P = .035).

Attempts to correlate phenotype characteristics associated with ethnicity, geographical divisions, or diseases to genotypes have had limited success. This means that current approaches for identifying phenotypes associated with haplotypes may be inadequate. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesize that a human phenome based on Ayurveda could provide an appropriate approach. Specifically, there could be a genetic basis for the three major constitutions (Prakriti) described in Ayurveda. The Prakriti classification is based on differences in physical, physiological, and psychologics characteristics and is independent of racial, ethnic, or geographical considerations. It may provide an appropriate means of classifying phenotypes to be considered collectively for genotyping. DESIGN: As a pilot study to test the hypothesis, we evaluated 76 subjects both for their Prakriti and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1 types. The genomic DNA was extracted using a standard protocol. Subsequently, HLA DRB1 typing was done by low-resolution polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primers and oligonucleotide probes. RESULTS: We observed a reasonable correlation between HLA type and Prakriti type. The complete absence of the HLA DRB1*02 allele in the Vata type and of HLA DRB1*13 in the Kapha type are significant, with X2 = 4.715 and p < 0.05. HLA DRB1*10 had higher allele frequency in the Kapha type than in the Pitta and Vata types. CONCLUSION: Ayurveda classifies the whole human population in three major constitutions as Vata, Pitta, Kapha and their possible combinations. Their homologous relation to human genetic structure needs to be studied for validation. If validated, our hypothesis would have far reaching implications for pharmacogenomics, modern genetics, human health, and Ayurveda.','Apr-05','12/15/2014 18:22','12/15/2014 18:22','349-353','2','11','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15865503','','Adult; Body Constitution; Female; Genetic Testing; HLA-DR Antigens; HLA-DRB1 Chains; Holistic Health; Humans; India; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Genetic; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Reference Values');

In the above emerging backdrop, \"Ayurveda\" has perhaps an important role to play as it can enable providing a theoretical and empirical base of personality traits and types. These Ayurvedic concepts are applicable to all human beings irrespective of caste, color, sex or race. Therefore, it is interesting to build on the Ayurvedic knowledge which has already given us so much since time immemorial, and validate some of these issues related to personality from psychological perspective. There are already certain efforts in understanding Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas Gunas. It can be furthered so that a comprehensive personality picture can be generated, which can have implications for health, career, education and many other dimensions of life.

Because of the critical role of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in these processes, we investigated the effect of berberine on this pathway. We found that berberine suppressed NF-kappaB activation induced by various inflammatory agents and carcinogens. This alkaloid also suppressed constitutive NF-kappaB activation found in certain tumor cells. Suppression of NF-kappaB activation occurred through the inhibition of phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha by the inhibition of IkappaB kinase (IKK) activation, leading to suppression of phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65, and finally to inhibition of NF-kappaB reporter activity. Inhibition of IKK by berbeine was direct and could be reversed by reducing agents. Site-specific mutagenesis suggested the involvement of cysteine residue 179 in IKK. Berberine also suppressed the expression of NF-kappaB-regulated gene products involved in antiapoptosis (Bcl-xL, Survivin, IAP1, IAP2, and cFLIP), proliferation (cyclin D1), inflammation (cyclooxygenase-2), and invasion (matrix metalloproteinase-9). Suppression of antiapoptotic gene products correlated with enhancement of apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and chemotherapeutic agents and with inhibition of TNF-induced cellular invasion. Overall, our results indicate that chemopreventive, apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities displayed by berberine may be mediated in part through the suppression of the NF-kappaB activation pathway. This may provide the molecular basis for the ability of berberine to act as an anticancer and anti-inflammatory agent.','1-Jul-08','12/15/2014 17:55','12/15/2014 17:55','5370-5379','13','68','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18593939','','Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Apoptosis; Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins; Berberine; Carcinogens; Cell Nucleus; Cells, Cultured; Cysteine; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Drug Synergism; Enzyme Activation; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; I-kappa B Kinase; Inflammation; Jurkat Cells; Models, Biological; Neoplasm Invasiveness; NF-kappa B; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Protein Transport; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha');

The antidiabetic activity of the individual plant parts is well known, but the synergistic or combined effects are unclear. The concept of polyherbalism has been highlighted in Sharangdhar Samhita, an Ayurvedic literature dating back to 1300 AD. Polyherbal formulations enhance the therapeutic action and reduce the concentrations of single herbs, thereby reducing adverse events. The aim of the present study is to formulate a polyherbal formulation and evaluate its antidiabetic potential in animals. The polyherbal formulation was formulated using the ethanol extracts of the stem bark of G. pentaphylla, whole plant of T. procumbens, and leaves of M. indica. The polyherbal formulation contains the ethanol extracts of G. pentaphylla, T. procumbens, and M. indica in the ratio of 2:2:1. The quality of the finished product was evaluated as per the World Health Organization\'s guidelines for the quality control of herbal materials. The quality testing parameters of the polyherbal formulation were within the limits. Fingerprint analysis of the polyherbal formulation showed effective separation at 366 nm, and it revealed that the active compound present in the polyherbal formulation and the active compounds present in all the three extracts were the same. The acute toxicity studies of the polyherbal formulation did not show any toxic symptoms in doses up to 2000 mg/kg over 14 days. The oral antidiabetic activity of the polyherbal formulation (250 and 500 mg/kg) was screened against streptozotocin (50 mg/kg; i.p.) + nicotinamide (120 mg/kg; i.p.) induced diabetes mellitus in rats. The investigational drug was administered for 21 consecutive days, and the effect of the polyherbal formulation on blood glucose levels was studied at regular intervals.

Studies have reported the cyclooxygenase COX-2-inhibitory activity of this polyphenol; however, none of the studies have established its antiinflammatory activity in the rat cotton pellet granuloma pouch model, which mimics subchronic inflammation in humans. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of curcumin in the cotton pellet granuloma pouch model. Furthermore, the interaction of curcumin with standard anti-inflammatory drugs at subeffective doses was studied to evaluate its potential role as adjuvant therapy. Administration of curcumin (240 mg/kg i.p.), aspirin (160 mg/kg i.p.) or rofecoxib (5 mg/kg i.p.) for 6 days in the cotton pellet granuloma pouch test exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity, as demonstrated by a decrease in both dry and wet weights of the cotton pellet as compared to the control animals. Lower doses of curcumin (120 mg/kg i.p.), aspirin (80 mg/kg i.p.) or rofecoxib (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) were ineffective. However, the combination of a subeffective dose of curcumin (120 mg/kg i.p.) with submaximal doses of aspirin (80 mg/kg i.p.) or rofecoxib (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) produced a synergistic effect. Furthermore, there was marked increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels (estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA) in the serum of the animals implanted with cotton pellets presenting marked inflammatory events. Daily administration of curcumin, aspirin or rofecoxib decreased the levels of TNF-alpha, further demonstrating anti-inflammatory activity. Curcumin in combination with aspirin or rofecoxib caused a further decrease in serum TNF-alpha levels. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate an anti-inflammatory effect for curcumin in the cotton pellet granuloma pouch test, possibly acting through COX enzyme inhibition, and further inhibiting the generation of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha.

The plant is used traditionally in Indian system of medicine as an antibacterial, antiperiodic, antidiarrheal and anticancer and it is also used in the treatment of ophthalmic infections. Its root, stem and leaves also find their use in treatment of various ailments and hence is used extensively in Ayurveda. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples of the whole plants of B. aristata were collected and identified. Hand and microtome sections were taken, stained and mounted and the cell content and cell wall structure were studied according to the method described by Kay and Johansen. Representative sketches were made with the help of camera Lucida. Methods for determining the quantitative values were the same as described elsewhere. For fluorescence analysis, the powder of the root, stem and leaf were examined under ultraviolet light. Total ash, acid insoluble ash and water-soluble ash values and water- and alcohol-soluble extractives were determined. RESULTS: The detailed investigations carried on the pharmacognosy of the root; stem and leaf of B. aristata have brought out some salient diagnostic features, which allow one to differentiate it from other substitutes and or adulterants. The determination of quantitative values, fluorescence analysis and the use of lycopodium spore analysis has specifically contributed to this differentiation. CONCLUSION: From the foregoing observation on the pharmacognosy of root, stem and leaf of B. aristata DC, the salient diagnostic characters of three parts have been presented, which can allow one to differentiate it from other substitutes and or adulterants.','Apr-13','12/14/2014 19:14','12/14/2014 19:14','234-240','4','32','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24991073','','');

This is a discipline in medicine which pragmatises the principle of first do no harm towards a wider and systematic application in clinical practice. It is however important to understand that despite of its huge potential in ensuring a safe practice of medicine through knowledge of avoidable causes of adversities, its path has never been easy. Applying principles of pharmacovigilance into the realm of traditional medicine particularly to Ayurveda is even more difficult for the issues of why and how of pharmacovigilance in light of historical practice and anecdotal evidences of safety in Ayurveda. Application of pharmacovigilance in Ayurveda thereby demands a careful and thoughtful observation of its needs and its methods of application in order to to maximize its impacts to ensure the patient safety to every extent possible.','Jan-11','12/15/2014 2:38','12/15/2014 2:38','48-52','1','2','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21897643','','');

An investigation has been carried out with rats and human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, to determine the anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential of MRQ. Results obtained demonstrate that MRQ can significantly and dose-dependently inhibit carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema (the inhibition at 3h was greater than at 1h after induction of oedema). MRQ could also increase the reaction time of rats in the hot-plate test (by 57% after the first hour of treatment), although it had no effect on the reaction time in the tail-flick test, indicating that MRQ possesses analgesic activity that is probably mediated via a supra-spinal effect.MRQ also exerted a dose-dependent (a) protective effect on heat-induced erythrocyte lysis, and (b) inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase activity. In RA patients, after 3 months of MRQ treatment, there was a marked improvement in the pain and inflammation experienced by the patients as well as in the mobility of the affected joints. From the overall results obtained, it may be concluded that MRQ possesses significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. Alteration in synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, membrane stabilization and anti-oxidant activity are some of the possible mechanisms through which MRQ mediates its anti-arthritic effects.','Apr-03','12/15/2014 18:22','12/15/2014 18:22','261-267','3-Feb','85','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12639750','','Adult; Aged; Analgesics, Non-Narcotic; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Carrageenan; Drug Combinations; Edema; Erythrocyte Membrane; Female; Hemolysis; Hot Temperature; Humans; Lipoxygenase Inhibitors; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Phytotherapy; Plants, Medicinal; Rats; Sri Lanka');

The medicinal plants with ethnomedicinal values are currently being screened for their therapeutic potential but their data and information are inadequately compared and analyzed with the Ayurveda and the phytochemical findings. METHODS: The present study evaluated ethnomedicinal plants and their uses following literature review, comparison, field observations, and analysis. Comparison was made against earlier standard literature of medicinal plants and ethnomedicine of the same area, the common uses of the Ayurveda and the latest common phytochemical findings. The field study for primary data collection was carried out from 2006-2008. RESULTS: The herbal medicine in far-west Nepal is the basis of treatment of most illness through traditional knowledge. The medicine is made available via ancient, natural health care practices such as tribal lore, home herbal remedy, and the Baidhya, Ayurveda and Amchi systems. The traditional herbal medicine has not only survived but also thrived in the trans-cultural environment with its intermixture of ethnic traditions and beliefs. The present assessment showed that traditional herbal medicine has flourished in rural areas where modern medicine is parsimoniously accessed because of the high cost and long travel time to health center. Of the 48 Nepalese medicinal plants assessed in the present communication, about half of the species showed affinity with the common uses of the Ayurveda, earlier studies and the latest phytochemical findings. The folk uses of Acacia catechu for cold and cough, Aconitum spicatum as an analgesic, Aesculus indica for joint pain, Andrographis paniculata for fever, Anisomeles indica for urinary affections, Azadirachta indica for fever, Euphorbia hirta for asthma, Taxus wallichiana for tumor control, and Tinospora sinensis for diabetes are consistent with the latest pharmacological findings, common Ayurvedic and earlier uses. CONCLUSIONS: Although traditional herbal medicine is only a primary means of health care in far-west Nepal, the medicine has been pursued indigenously with complementing pharmacology and the Ayurveda. Therefore, further pharmacological evaluation of traditional herbal medicine deserves more attention.','2010','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','35','','6','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21144003','','Herbal Medicine; Humans; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Medicine, Traditional; Nepal; Phytotherapy; Plants, Medicinal');

The permeability studies revealed poor permeability of AKBA and moderate absorption of KBA with a P(app) value of 1.69 x 10(-6) cm/s. Most of KBA and AKBA were found to be retained by the Caco-2 monolayer. Neither KBA nor AKBA could be identified as substrates of P-glycoprotein.

Kulattha is acclaimed to have litholytic property in ayurvedic literature. We decided to compare the litholytic property of Kulattha with potassium citrate, an agent used to reduce stone recurrence in modern medicine. METHODS: Forty seven patients with diagnosis of calcium oxalate renal calculi were taken in study. Twenty four patients received Kulattha (Group I) and 23 patients were given potassium citrate(Group II) for a period of 6 months. The size of renal calculi was studied by periodic ultrasound assessment in both groups. RESULTS: Mean size of stone in group I at 0 month and at 6 month were 5.42 +/- 1.55 mm and 4.26 +/- 1.2 mm. mean size of stone in group II at 0 month and at 6 month was 6.46 +/- 3.08 mm and 4.64 +/- 1.40 mm. Statistical analysis showed that P value of less than 0.05 was seen in the first group from 0 to 6 month. There was no significant difference in the stone size within group II when the 3rd month and 6th month visit was compared with initial visit. CONCLUSION: Kulattha can be used to reduce the recurrence of calcium oxalate stone and it is shown to have a better result than the use of conventional potassium citrate in such patients.','May-10','12/15/2014 2:52','12/15/2014 2:52','286-289','','58','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21117346','','Adolescent; Adult; Child; Diuretics; Dolichos; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; India; Kidney Calculi; Lithotripsy; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Phytotherapy; Potassium Citrate; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Seeds; Treatment Outcome');

Triphala is a popular formulation of the Ayurvedic system of medicine. Our findings have shown that Triphala in diet has significantly reduced the benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] induced forestomach papillomagenesis in mice. In the short term treatment groups, the tumor incidences were lowered to 77.77% by both doses of Triphala mixed diet. In the case of long-term treatment the tumor incidences were reduced to 66.66% and 62.50% respectively by 2.5% and 5% triphala containing diet. Tumor burden was 7.27 +/- 1.16 in the B(a)P treated control group, whereas it reduced to 3.00 +/- 0.82 (p < 0.005) by 2.5% dose and 2.33 +/- 1.03 (p < 0.001) by 5% dose of Triphala.

It was important to observe that Triphala was more effective in reducing tumor incidences compared to its individual constituents. Triphala also significantly increased the antioxidant status of animals which might have contributed to the chemoprevention.

Br., and Rubia cordifolia L. were selected on the basis of their ethnobotanical use and of scientific evidence that suggests a potential efficacy in the treatment of bone-loss diseases. The antiresorptive properties of the four plants have been investigated. The aim was to provide adequate evidence for the exploitation of natural compounds as alternative therapeutics for the treatment of diseases caused by increased osteoclast activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decoctions were prepared from dried plant material according to the traditional procedure and standardization by HPLC was performed using marker compounds for each species. Total polyphenols, flavonoids and radical scavenging activity of the decoctions were also determined. The bioactivity of the plant decoctions was evaluated in subsequent phases. (1) A cytotoxicity screening was performed on the mouse monocytic RAW 264.7 cell line to define the concentrations that could be utilized in the following step. (2) The antiresorptive properties of plant decoctions were compared with that of a \"gold standard\" drug (alendronate) by measuring osteoclastogenesis inhibition and osteoclast apoptosis. (3) The toxic effect on bone forming cells was excluded by evaluating the impact on the proliferation of osteogenic precursors (mesenchymal stem cells, MSC). RESULTS: All the decoctions inhibited osteoclastogenesis similarly to alendronate at the highest doses, but Hemidesmus indicus and Rubia cordifolia were also effective at lower concentrations. Apoptosis increased significantly when cells were exposed to the highest concentration of Emblica officinalis, Hemidesmus indicus, and Rubia cordifolia. All concentrations of Emblica officinalis tested inhibited the proliferation of osteogenic precursors, while only the highest doses of Asparagus racemosus and Rubia cordifolia were toxic. On the contrary, Hemidesmus indicus did not affect osteogenic precursor growth at any concentration tested. CONCLUSION: Among the medicinal plants included in the study, Hemidesmus indicus showed the greatest antiosteoclastic activity without toxic effect on osteogenic precursors. Therefore, Hemidesmus indicus exhibits the properties of an antiresorptive drug and represents the ideal candidate for further clinical investigations.','11-Jun-14','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','462-470','2','154','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24786575','','');

Astrology and Ayurveda are inseparable in human life. Role of the Astrology in healthy life and pathogenesis of the disease is well known to Indians. When a physician knows etiology of the disease, he attempts to treat the disease with specific medication, diet and life style and also avoiding causative factors. In a case where a physician is unable to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and to treat, the patient depends upon Astrology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective pharmacoepidemiological study involving pharmacists of Gujarat region was carried out in the year 2005. Pharmacists (n = 351) working in general and Ayurvedic medical stores were selected from 12 districts of Gujarat region. The pharmacists were explained about the objective of the study and were given a pretested, validated questionnaire. OUTCOME MEASURES: The questionnaire included the questions regarding herbal MVEM used most commonly, percentage sale of herbal MVEM - sold with or without prescriptions - age group of patients and professional groups who used these drugs most commonly. RESULTS: The number of individuals using MVEM was highest in the age group of 11-20 years (17.54%), followed by the 21-40 years group (17.12%), supporting the results that the professional group of students (17.29%) and the persons of business or service class (15.29%) are the highest users of these medicines. Evaluation of various constituents in the marketed polyherbal MVEM revealed that Brahmi (Bacopa monniera), Shankhpushpi (Evolvulus alsinoides), Ashwangandha (Withania somnifera), Jatamansi (Nardostychos jatamansi), Vacha (Acorus calamus) and Amla (Phyllanthus emblica) were the common ingredients in the polyherbal preparations.

Other medical systems, such as Chinese medicine, Indian Ayurvedic medicine, Unani medicine, Greco-Roman medicine and the country\'s rich cultures and traditions have greatly influenced the way traditional Bhutanese medicine evolved. However, Buddhist philosophy remains the mainstream of this medical system. gSo-ba Rig-pa\'s principles are based on the perception the human body is composed of three main elements: rLung (\'Air\'), mKhris-pa (\'Bile\') and Bad-kan (\'Phlegm\'). When these three elements are balanced in the body a person is said to be healthy. The pathophysiology is also different from other medical systems, and the close link to Buddhism is reflected in the spiritual dimensions and the perception that all suffering is caused by ignorance. The treatment of diseases includes behavioral modification, physiotherapy, herbal medicines, minor surgery and spiritual healing. This makes the traditional Bhutanese medicine a unique and holistic health care system. The traditional medicine is an integrated and recognized part of the formal health care services in Bhutan under the auspices of the Ministry of Health. The article highlights three main points which can be learned from the Bhutanese experience: (1) the strong tradition of herbal medicines within gSo-ba Rig-pa forms a unique opportunity to prospect for new leads for development of pharmaceuticals, (2) the availability of the traditional medicine along with biomedicine broadens the health care choices for patients, and (3) the experiences of integrating two conceptually very different health care systems within one ministry contains important managerial lessons to be learned.','Jan-07','12/15/2014 18:09','12/15/2014 18:09','161-167','1','38','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17539263','','Bhutan; Buddhism; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Herbal Medicine; Holistic Health; Humans; Medicine, Traditional; Spirituality');

RESULTS: The Ayurvedic management of Prameha emphasizes dietary and lifestyle recommendations and herbal preparations, in accordance with the psychophysiologic constitution of the patient. Ayurveda also addresses the management of psychologic factors that contribute to the development of Prameha. Ayurvedic treatment known as Apatarpana (balanced diet with restricted calories) and Santarpana (highly nutritious, high-calorie diet intended to increase weight) are recommended for patients with type 2 and type 1 diabetes, respectively.

The results showed that there was statistically significant rise (p<0.001) in all of them-Hb, PCV, TRBC, MCV, MCH, MCHC and plasma iron, percent saturation and plasma ferritin. Total iron binding capacity decreased significantly (p<0.001). The response of most of Ayurvedic preparations was better than Allopathic preparation and there was no side effect as observed with iron salts The Hb regeneration rate was 0.10 g/dl/day for Allopathic preparation; while it was above this value for all Ayurvedic preparations exceptPradarantaka Lauha which was least effective.Sarva-Juara-Hara Lauha was the drug of choice as Hb regeneration with it was highest 0.16 g/dl/day.

AIMS: This study was carried out to evaluate the anti-secretory and the anti-ulcerogenic activities of the churna and to compare its activity with that of ranitidine in a pyloric ligated model of rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four groups of rats with 6 animals in each served as the ulcer controls, churna low dose (500 mg/kg), churna high dose (750mg/kg) and ranitidine (25mg/kg). The control group rats received only vehicle (2% (v/v) gum acacia), while the rats of the other groups received the respective dose of the churna or ranitidine which was suspended in the vehicle. The treatments were given twice a day, orally, for two days. After 1 hour of the last dose, pyloric ligations were performed and the rats were sacrificed for evaluation after four hours of the ligations. The gastric contents were collected and its volume, pH and acidity were measured. The numbers of ulcers and their lengths were measured which were used to calculate the gastric irritancy index and the curative ratio. The histological examinations of the gastric tissues were also performed. RESULTS: The churna, in both doses, significantly decreased the volumes of the gastric contents, the ulcer score, the length of the ulcer, the gastric irritancy index and pH increased as compared to those in the control group. The effects of the churna were comparable to that of ranitidine. The histopathological evaluation of the gastric tissue also supported the results. CONCLUSION: Avipattikar churna has anti-secretory and anti-ulcerogenic effects which are comparable to those of ranitidine in peptic ulcer diseases.','Jun-13','12/14/2014 18:55','12/14/2014 18:55','1135-1139','6','7','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23905120','','');

The prolonged use of this drug, irrespective of its known lethal effects, is governed by the practice of effective detoxification processes that have been used for decades. However, the processing methods of Ayurveda and TCM are different, and no comparative study has been carried out to evaluate their differences.The objective of the present study was to carry out comparative chemical profiling of the roots of Aconitum heterophyllum Wall, A. carmichaelii Debx., and A. kusnezoffii Reichb. after application of two detoxification methods used in Ayurveda and one method used in TCM . RESULTS: Analysis of the processed samples was carried out by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS). The results obtained in the study demonstrate that all three processing methods used in Ayurveda and TCM effectively extract the diester diterpenoid alkaloids and led to their conversion into monoester diterpenoid alkaloids. The efficiency of the processes in reduction of toxic alkaloid contents can be stated as: Processing with waterâ€‰>â€‰Shodhana with cow milkâ€‰>â€‰Shodhana with cow urine. The analysis method was validated as per ICH-Q2R1 guidelines and all the parameters were found to comply with the recommendations stated in the guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: There have been no reports till date, to compare the processing methods used in Ayurveda with the methods used in TCM for detoxification of aconite roots. Our study demonstrates that, these methods used in both the traditional systems of medicine, efficiently detoxify the aconite roots. Amongst the three selected procedures, the TCM method of decoction with water is the most efficient. Through experimental evidences, we prove the conversion of toxic diester diterpenoid alkaloids to relatively safer monoester diterpenoid alkaloids. Thus, this study demonstrates that comparative study on the traditional experiences accumulated in different medical systems is useful for expanding their respective applications.','2013','12/14/2014 18:55','12/14/2014 18:55','169','1','7','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24156713','','');

Although a wide array of medicinal plants play a role in the prevention and treatment of diabetes, there are few reports of the application of herbal medicines in amelioration of renal fibrosis, or the underlying mechanisms by which such benefits are mediated. The efficacy of the Ayurvedic antidiabetic medicine Salacia oblonga (SO) root on rat renal fibrosis was investigated. An aqueous extract from SO (100 mg/kg, p.o., 6 weeks) diminished renal glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, as revealed by van Giesen-staining. SO also reduced renal salt-soluble, acid-soluble and salt-insoluble collagen contents. These changes were accompanied by normalization of hypoalbuminemia and BUN. Gene profiling revealed that the increase in transcripts encoding the glomerulosclerotic mediators collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1), transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²1, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 observed in ZDF rat kidney was suppressed by SO. In rat-derived mesangial cells, similar to the effect of the AT1 antagonist telmisartan, SO and its major component mangiferin suppressed the stimulatory effect of angiotensin II on proliferation and increased mRNA expression and/or activities of collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin, AT1, TGF-Î²1 and PAI-1. Considered together the present findings demonstrate that SO attenuates diabetic renal fibrosis, at least in part by suppressing anigiotensin II/AT1 signaling.

(AR) is an Ayurvedic rasayana used as an adaptogen. Adaptogenic drugs are those which are useful as anti-stress agents by promoting non-specific resistance of the body. Although, the adaptogenic effect of AR is well documented, its use in psychological disorders like depression is not scientifically evaluated. Hence, the present investigation evaluates the antidepressant effect of methanolic extract of roots of AR (MAR) standardized to saponins (62.2% w/w). Rats were given MAR in the doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg daily for 7 days and then subjected to forced swim test (FST) and learned helplessness test (LH). The results show that MAR decreases immobility in FST and increases avoidance response in LH indicating antidepressant activity. In behavioral experiments, MAR increased the number of head twitches produced by 5-HTP and increased clonidine-induced aggressive behavior indicating facilitatory effect on both serotonergic and adrenergic systems respectively. However, MAR had insignificant effect on l-DOPA-induced aggressive behavior indicating absence of activity on dopaminergic system. MAR also reversed changes to the endogenous antioxidant system induced by FST. Thus, MAR has significant antidepressant activity and this effect is probably mediated through the serotonergic and the noradrenergic systems and augmentation of antioxidant defenses.','Jan-09','12/15/2014 17:55','12/15/2014 17:55','283-290','3','91','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18692086','','5-Hydroxytryptophan; Adrenergic alpha-Agonists; Aggression; Animals; Antidepressive Agents; Antioxidants; Asparagus Plant; Clonidine; Dopamine Agents; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Head Movements; Helplessness, Learned; Hippocampus; Hyperkinesis; Levodopa; Lipid Peroxidation; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mice; Neostriatum; Plant Extracts; Plant Roots; Rats; Superoxide Dismutase; Swimming');

Terminalia arjuna (Combretaceae), a tropical woody tree occurring throughout India and known locally as Kumbuk, is a medicinal plant rich in tannins and triterpenes that is used extensively in Ayurvedic medicine as a cardiac tonic. The aim of the present collaborative work was to test six solvent extracts from the bark of Terminalia arjuna for antigenotoxic activity using in vitro short-term tests. Terminalia arjuna extracts were obtained by sequential extraction using acetone, methanol, methanol + HCl, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and ethyl ether. The antigenotoxic properties of these extracts were investigated by assessing the inhibition of genotoxicity of the directacting mutagen 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4NQO) using the \"comet\" assay and the micronucleus (MN) test. Human peripheral blood leukocytes were incubated with different concentrations of the six extracts (from 5 to 100 microg/ mL) and with 4NQO (1 and 2 microg/mL, for the \"comet\" assay and MN test, respectively). Each extract/4NQO combination was tested twice; in each experiment, positive control (4NQO alone) and negative control (1% DMSO) were set. \"Comet\" assay results showed that acetone and methanol extracts were highly effective in reducing the DNA damage caused by 4NQO, whereas the acidic methanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and ethyl ether extracts showed less marked or no antigenotoxic activity. In the MN test, a decrease in 4NQO genotoxicity was observed by testing this mutagen in the presence of acetone, methanol, chloroform, and ethyl acetate extracts, even though the extent of inhibition was not always statistically significant.','1999','12/15/2014 18:22','12/15/2014 18:22','119-125','2','18','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15281223','','4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide; Antimutagenic Agents; Comet Assay; DNA Damage; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Micronucleus Tests; Mutagens; Plant Extracts; Quinolones; Solvents; Terminalia');

Cardiac autonomic dysfunction in stroke has implications on morbidity and mortality. Ayurveda (Indian system of medicine) describes stroke as pakshaghata. We intended to study the effect of Ayurveda therapies on the cardiac autonomic dysfunction. Methods. Fifty patients of ischemic stroke (middle cerebral artery territory) (mean age 39.26 Â± 9.88 years; male 43, female 7) were recruited within one month of ictus. All patients received standard allopathic medications as advised by neurologist. In addition, patients were randomized to receive physiotherapy (Group I) or Ayurveda treatment (Group II) for 14 days. Continuous electrocardiogram and finger arterial pressure were recorded for 15 min before and after treatments and analyzed offline to obtain heart rate and blood pressure variability and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). Results were analysed by RMANOVA. Results. Patients in Group II showed statistically significant improvement in cardiac autonomic parameters. The standard deviation of normal to normal intervals,and total and low frequency powers were significantly enhanced (F = 8.16, P = 0.007, F = 9.73, P = 0.004, F = 13.51, and P = 0.001, resp.). The BRS too increased following the treatment period (F = 10.129, P = 0.004). Conclusions. The current study is the first to report a positive modulation of cardiac autonomic activity after adjuvant Ayurveda treatment in ischemic stroke. Further long term studies are warranted.','2014','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','634695','','2014','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24971149','','');

Limitation of the use of MSCs for therapeutic purposes is attributed to the onset of senescence and slowing down of proliferation upon repeated passaging. Dhanwantram kashaya (DK), a synthetic herbal formulation, is widely used in Ayurvedic medicine as a growth stimulant in children and for nerve regeneration. In this study, we evaluated the effects of DK on the proliferation, viability and senescence of human Wharton jelly MSCs (WJMSCs) in vitro. RESULTS: Using the MTT proliferation assay and live/dead trypan blue analysis, we found that DK increased proliferation of WJMSCS up to three folds when supplemented in the culture media. The BrdU cell proliferation assay showed a substantial increase in WJMSCs treated with DK. Notably, the Î²-galactosidase senescence assay revealed that drug treated WJMSCs at late passage still had intact and viable WJMSCs whereas the untreated cells exhibited profound senescence. CONCLUSION: These studies indicate that DK enhances the quality of WJMSCs by not only increasing the proliferation rate and decreasing their turnover time but also by delaying senescence. We have, thus, identified for the first time that a traditional Ayurvedic formulation, Dhanwantram kashaya, used as a growth enhancer, is able to improve the yield and quality of stem cells in vitro and could be an effective non-toxic supplement for culturing WJMSCs for clinical applications.','Jun-13','12/14/2014 19:14','12/14/2014 19:14','283-290','3','46','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23692087','','Cell Aging; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Cell Survival; Humans; Mesenchymal Stromal Cells; Plant Preparations; Umbilical Cord; Wharton Jelly');

The aim of the present work is to evaluate the effect of ethanolic extract of Nardostachys jatamansi rhizomes on doxorubicin induced myocardial injury with respect to lipid metabolism in serum and heart of Wistar albino rats. Altered lipid metabolism alters the cardiac function which is mainly due to changes in the property of the cardiac cell membrane. Doxorubicin exhibits cardiotoxicity by inhibition of fatty acid oxidation in the heart. The rats treated with a single dose of doxorubicin (15 mg/kg) intraperitoneally showed an increase in serum and cardiac lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and phospholipids), along with a significant rise in serum low density lipoproteins (LDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and drop in high density lipoproteins (HDL) levels, resulting in alteration of serum and cardiac lipid metabolizing enzymes. Pretreatment with a extract of Nardostachys jatamansi (500 mg/kg) orally for seven days to doxorubicin induced rats showed a significant prevention in the lipid status with the activities of the lipid metabolizing enzymes. Histopathological observations were also in correlation with the biochemical parameters.

The Ayurveda and Deshiya Chikitsa systems use mainly plant and herbal preparations for the treatment of diseases--the former uses about 2000 species, the latter about 500. The plants are used singly or as mixtures. The traditional systems of medicine have a vast literature, mainly in the form of manuscripts. The principle of the Ayurvedic system is to consider the body as a whole, ailments of different organs not being treated separately as in modern medicine. Similarly, Ayurveda takes into account the actions of the drug in its entirety. Research therefore must be carried out in hospitals or biological laboratories and not in chemical laboratories where plant extracts are subject inevitably to chemical reactions. Therefore the chemical approach to identify active principles is a complete deviation from the principles of traditional medicine. Research on plants should be carried out for the further development of traditional systems of medicine and not to their detriment. The threat of extinction of certain species of plants and herbs is stressed, the causes being the destruction of jungles, the greater demand for raw materials for increased manufacture of traditional medicinal preparations, the absence of organised cultivation of medicinal plants, and unscientific harvesting.

(Zingiberaceae) has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic, Chinese and Tibb-Unani herbal medicines for the treatment of various illnesses that involve inflammation and which are caused by oxidative stress. Although gingerols and shogaols are the major bioactive compounds present in Zingiber officinale, their molecular mechanisms of actions and the relationship between their structural features and the activity have not been well studied. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the present study was to examine and compare the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of gingerols and their natural analogues to determine their structure-activity relationship and molecular mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro activities of the compounds [6]-gingerol, [8]-gingerol, [10]-gingerol and [6]-shogaol were evaluated for scavenging of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picyrlhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, inhibition of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (f-MLP) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), inhibition of lipopolysaccharide induced nitrite and prostaglandin E(2) production in RAW 264.7 cells. RESULTS: In the antioxidant activity assay, [6]-gingerol, [8]-gingerol, [10]-gingerol and [6]-shogaol exhibited substantial scavenging activities with IC(50) values of 26.3, 19.47, 10.47 and 8.05 microM against DPPH radical, IC(50) values of 4.05, 2.5, 1.68 and 0.85 microM against superoxide radical and IC(50) values of 4.62, 1.97, 1.35 and 0.72 microM against hydroxyl radical, respectively. The free radical scavenging activity of these compounds also enhanced with increasing concentration (P<0.05). On the other hand, all the compounds at a concentration of 6 microM have significantly inhibited (P<0.05) f-MLP-stimulated oxidative burst in PMN. In addition, production of inflammatory mediators (NO and PGE(2)) has been inhibited significantly (P<0.05) and dose-dependently. CONCLUSIONS: 6-Shogaol has exhibited the most potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which can be attributed to the presence of alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone moiety. The carbon chain length has also played a significant role in making 10-gingerol as the most potent among all the gingerols.

Skin prick tests were performed on 64 children with symptoms pertaining to respiratory allergy (32 each in study and control group) using crude antigenic food extracts. Oral food challenges were administered to children to confirm or rule out allergenicity of food (s) incriminated on the basis of the clinical history and/or a positive skin test. Parental history of food restriction alone, in absence of positive skin prick test was of little value in predicting a positive response to the food challenges (1 challenge positive out of 77 based on food restriction: 1.29%). Only 27.02% and 18.75% of positive skin tests were found to be clinically significant in study and control groups respectively. Traditionally, food beliefs were upheld in only 12.5% children for immediate onset clinical reactions (with 5.31% of the foods restricted in their diet) and 9.37% children for delayed onset clinical reactions (with 3.19% of the foods restricted in their diet).

It is traditionally used for the treatment of leprosy, inflammation, scrofula, anthelmintic, antilithic, diuretic, deobstruent and cardiac disorders. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the phytochemical constituents and antioxidant activities of the ethanol leaf extract of Melia azedarach (MA) and its protective effect against H2O2-induced cellular damage in cultured lymphocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dose-dependent study of MA (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 Âµg/ml) was used to study in vitro radical scavenging assays. The effective dose of MA (60 Âµg/ml) was further used to study the H2O2-induced DNA damage (comet assay and DNA fragmentation assay) in cultured lymphocytes. RESULTS: The ethanol extract of MA (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 Âµg/ml) exhibited a significant dose-dependent inhibition of in vitro radical scavenging assays and their corresponding IC50 values as follows: hydroxyl radical (26.50 Â± 0.26 Âµg/ml), superoxide anion (30.00 Â± 0.32 Âµg/ml), nitric oxide radical (48.00 Â± 0.48 Âµg/ml), DPPH radical (30.55 Â± 0.32 Âµg/ml) and reducing power (22.00 Â± 0.22 Âµg/ml). The increase in the severity of DNA damage and TBARS was increased significantly (p<0.05) at 500 ÂµM H2O2-treated cultured lymphocytes and RBC cellular membranes. The phytochemical screening studies identified 13 chemical constituents present in the leaf extract of MA.

Ayurveda, whose history goes back to 5000 b.c., is one of the ancient health care systems. The Ayurveda was developed through daily life experiences with the mutual relationship between mankind and nature. The ancient text of Ayurveda reports more than 2000 plant species for their therapeutic potentials. Besides Ayurveda, other traditional and folklore systems of health care were developed in the different time periods in Indian subcontinent, where more than 7500 plant species were used.

Renewed interest of developing as well as developed countries in the natural resources has opened new horizons for the exploration of natural sources with the perspectives of safety and efficacy. The development of these traditional systems of medicines with the perspectives of safety, efficacy and quality will help not only to preserve this traditional heritage but also to rationalize the use of natural products in the health care.

Chronic cholestasis eventually leads to hepatic cirrhosis and fibrosis, and rodent chronic cholestasis models are used to study aspects of fibrosis and cirrhosis. Cholestasis-induced liver injury and fibrosis are associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Few pharmacological therapies exist for treatment of cholestasis or cirrhosis, but it is known that humans with better nutritional intake are less likely to develop certain types of cirrhosis. Eugenia jambolana (Jamun) is a tropical berry fruit rich in antioxidant anthocyanin compounds. AIM: As anthocyanins decrease cellular lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, it was hypothesized that Jamun fruit extract (JFE) administration could protect against cholestatic liver injury and inflammation in mice. METHOD: Starting 24 h after sham or bile-duct ligation (BDL) surgery, male C57Bl/6 mice were administered vehicle or JFE (100 mg/kg, po) for 10 days. RESULTS: Mice that underwent BDL had elevated serum ALT levels, which were reduced to 60% by JFE treatment. Likewise, BDL caused hepatic inflammation, macrophage infiltration, fibrosis and necrosis, all of which were largely improved by JFE. Interestingly, hepatoprotection was observed in JFE-treated BDL mice, despite suppressed transporter expression and increased hepatic bile acid concentrations. CONCLUSION: Jamun fruit phytochemicals decreased hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and protected against hepatocellular injury in mice.

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian medical system has given due emphasis on this and postulated various measures to minimize the risks. These measures start well before conception. According to Ayurvedic principles, proper preparation of the parents is an essential prerequisite for a healthy progeny. Pre-conception care is a set of interventions that identifies biomedical behavioral and social risks to the health of the mother and the baby. It includes both-prevention and management, emphasizing health issues that require action before conception, very early in pregnancy, for maximal impact. For meeting the objective of healthy progeny, Ayurveda scholars felt the importance of six procreative factors (Shadgarbhkarabhavas) such as Matrija, Pitrija, Aatmaja, Rasaja, Satmyaja, and Sattvaja. The conglomeration of these procreative factors is must for healthy progeny. The physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being of the person, proper nutrition of the mother during pregnancy, and practice of a wholesome regimen, play a prime role in achieving a healthy offspring, thus structuring a healthy family, society, and nation. Negligence toward any of these factors becomes a cause for unhealthy and defective child birth.

Therefore, the ability of a well-characterized crude ginger extract to inhibit joint swelling in an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis, streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis, was compared to that of a fraction containing only gingerols and their derivatives. Both extracts were efficacious in preventing joint inflammation. However, the crude dichloromethane extract, which also contained essential oils and more polar compounds, was more efficacious (when normalized to gingerol content) in preventing both joint inflammation and destruction.

Uses of this genus as herbal medicines have been first recorded by the Greek and Roman ancient physicians. In the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, from the 20 Inula spp. distributed in China, three are used as Traditional Chinese medicines, named Tumuxiang, Xuanfuhua and Jinfeicao. These medicines are used as expectorants, antitussives, diaphoretics, antiemetics, and bactericides. Moreover, Inula helenium L. which is mentioned in Minoan, Mycenaean, Egyptian/Assyrian pharmacotherapy and Chilandar Medical Codex, is good to treat neoplasm, wound, freckles and dandruff. Many other Inula spp. are used in Ayurvedic and Tibetan traditional medicinal systems for the treatment of diseases such as bronchitis, diabetes, fever, hypertension and several types of inflammation. This review is a critical evaluation of the published data on the more relevant ethnopharmacological and medicinal uses of Inula spp. and on their metabolites biological activities. This study allows the identification of the ethnopharmacological knowledge of this genus and will provide insight into the emerging pharmacological applications of Inula spp. facilitating the prioritirization of future investigations. The corroboration of the ethnopharmacological applications described in the literature with proved biological activities of Inula spp. secondary metabolites will also be explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The major scientific databases including ScienceDirect, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science were queried for information on the genus Inula using various keyword combinations, more than 180 papers and patents related to the genus Inula were consulted. The International Plant Name Index was also used to confirm the species names. RESULTS: Although the benefits of Inula spp. are known for centuries, there are insufficient scientific studies to certify it. Most of the patents are registered by Chinese researchers, proving the traditional use of these plants in their country. Although a total of sixteen Inula species were reported in the literature to have ethnopharmacological applications, the species Inula cappa (Buch.-Ham. ex D.Don) DC., Inula racemosa Hook.f., Inula viscosa (L.) Aiton [actually the accepted name is Dittrichia viscosa (L.) Greuter], Inula helenium, Inula britannica L. and Inula japonica Thunb. are the most frequently cited ones since their ethnopharmacological applications are vast. They are used to treat a large spectrum of disorders, mainly respiratory, digestive, inflammatory, dermatological, cancer and microbial diseases. Fifteen Inula spp. crude extracts were investigated and showed interesting biological activities. From these, only 7 involved extracts of the reported spp. used in traditional medicine and 6 of these were studied to isolate the bioactive compounds. Furthermore, 90 bioactive compounds were isolated from 16 Inula spp. The characteristic compounds of the genus, sesquiterpene lactones, are involved in a network of biological effects, and in consequence, the majority of the experimental studies are focused on these products, especially on their cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities. The review shows the chemical composition of the genus Inula and presents the pharmacological effects proved by in vitro and in vivo experiments, namely the cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory (with focus on nitric oxide, arachidonic acid and NF-ÎºB pathways), antimicrobial, antidiabetic and insecticidal activities. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are ca. 100 species in the genus Inula, only a few species have been investigated so far. Eight of the sixteen Inula spp. with ethnopharmacological application had been subjected to biological evaluations and/or phytochemical studies. Despite Inula royleana DC. and Inula obtusifolia A. Kerner are being used in traditional medicine, as far as we are aware, these species were not subjected to phytochemical or pharmacological studies. The biological activities exhibited by the compounds isolated from Inula spp., mainly anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic, support some of the described ethnopharmacological applications. Sesquiterpene lactone derivatives were identified as the most studied class, being britannilactone derivatives the most active ones and present high potential as anti-inflammatory drugs, although, their pharmacological effects, dose-response relationship and toxicological investigations to assess potential for acute or chronic adverse effects should be further investigated. The experimental results are promising, but the precise mechanism of action, the compound or extract toxicity, and the dose to be administrated for an optimal effect need to be investigated. Also human trials (some preclinical studies proved to be remarkable) should be further investigated. The genus Inula comprises species useful not only in medicine but also in other domains which makes it a high value-added plant.','11-Jun-14','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','286-310','2','154','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754913','','');

Pippaliyadi did not have any adverse developmental effects with low doses, however, with the five times higher dose, a decrease in body weight of the pups was observed. The reproductive performance of the progeny born to mothers treated with pippaliyadi was not significantly affected. The present study suggests that in utero exposure to pippaliyadi does not have any adverse effect on the postnatal development and reproductive performance of the F(1) progeny.','12-Feb-07','12/15/2014 18:09','12/15/2014 18:09','406-411','3','109','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17088035','','Animals; Contraceptive Agents, Female; Embelia; Female; Fruit; Hair; Male; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Piper; Plant Preparations; Pregnancy; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reproduction; Vagina');

This substance has been used extensively in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries for its anti-oxidant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antiseptic activity. More recently curcumin has been found to possess anti-cancer properties linked to its pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative actions. The underlying mechanisms of these diverse effects are complex, not fully elucidated and subject of intense scientific debate. Despite increasing evidence indicating that different cation channels can be a molecular target for curcumin, very little is known about the effect of curcumin on chloride channels. Since, (i) the molecular structure of curcumin indicates that the substance could potentially interact with chloride channels, (ii) chloride channels play a role during the apoptotic process and regulation of the cell volume, and (iii) apoptosis is a well known effect of curcumin, we set out to investigate whether or not curcumin could (i) exert a modulatory effect (direct or indirect) on the swelling activated chloride current ICl(swell) in a human cell system, therefore (ii) affect cell volume regulation and (iii) ultimately modulate cell survival. The ICl(swell) channels, which are essential for regulating the cell volume after swelling, are also known to be activated under isotonic conditions as an early event in the apoptotic process. Here we show that long-term exposure of a human kidney cell line to extracellular 0.1-10 Î¼M curcumin modulates ICl(swell) in a dose-dependent manner (0.1 Î¼M curcumin is ineffective, 0.5-5.0 Î¼M curcumin increase, while 10 Î¼M curcumin decrease the current), and short-term exposure to micromolar concentrations of curcumin does not affect ICl(swell) neither if applied from the extracellular nor from the intracellular side - therefore, a direct effect of curcumin on ICl(swell) can be ruled out. Furthermore, we show that curcumin exposure induces apoptosis in human kidney cells, and at a concentration of 5.0-10 Î¼M induces the appearance of a sub-population of cells with a dramatically increased volume. In these cells the regulation of the cell volume seems to be impaired, most likely as a consequence of the ICl(swell) blockade. Similarly, 50 Î¼M curcumin induced apoptosis, caused cell cycle arrest in G1-phase and increased the volume of human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells. The cell cycle arrest in G1 phase may be the mechanism underlying the volume increase observed in this cell line after exposure to curcumin.','26-Feb-12','12/15/2014 2:38','12/15/2014 2:38','123-135','3-Feb','292','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22178266','','Apoptosis; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Size; Cell Survival; Chloride Channels; Curcumin; Flow Cytometry; HT29 Cells; Humans; Kidney; Patch-Clamp Techniques');

Pretreatment of dopaminergic (N27 cell lines) cells with BME exhibited significant cytoprotective effect as evidenced by the attenuation of ROT-induced oxidative stress and cell death. Further, the neuroprotective efficacy of BME was assessed in prepubertal mice administered ROT (i.p. 1.0Â mg/kg b.w./day) for 7Â days. BME treatment significantly offset ROT-induced oxidative damage in striatum (St) and other brain regions as evident by the normalized levels of oxidative markers (malondialdehyde, ROS levels, and hydroperoxides) and restoration of depleted GSH levels. Further, BME effectively normalized the protein carbonyl content in all brain regions suggesting its ability to prevent protein oxidation. Furthermore, BME treatment restored the activity levels of cytosolic antioxidant enzymes, neurotransmitter function, and dopamine levels in St. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the neuroprotective effects of BM extract may be at least in part related to its ability to enhance reduced glutathione and antioxidant defenses in brain regions.

Hence, the present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the bronchodilator and anti-anaphylactic activity of the stem bark of Myrica sapida. METHODS: Experimental models studied were acetylcholine induced bronchospasm in guinea pigs, egg albumin induced anaphylaxis in guinea pigs, in vitro studies on tracheal strip of egg albumin sensitized guinea pigs. RESULTS: Treatment with ethanolic extract of M. sapida, 75 mg/kg, orally resulted in significant protection against acetylcholine aerosol induced bronchospasm and allergen induced anaphylaxis in guinea pigs.

These medications are increasingly associated with lead poisoning, often accompanied by anemia. We compared the relative hematopoietic toxicity of Ayurvedic lead poisoning with a common form of occupational lead poisoning. MATERIAL/METHODS: We retrospectively studied 66 adult lead intoxications: 43 published Ayurvedic cases identified in published reports by searching MEDLINE (1966 to November 2005); 4 Ayurvedic patients seen at a referral center; and 19 lead paint intoxications from the same center. We considered patients\' age, gender and blood lead at presentation, and then compared the groups with respect to hematopoietic parameters. RESULTS: Ayurvedic lead poisoning was associated with higher blood lead (p<0.001), more basophilic stippling (p<0.001), lower hemoglobin (p<0.001) and higher protoporphyrin (p<0.001). Multiple regression adjusted for blood lead and gender found Ayurvedic lead poisoning associated with a 36.2 g/L (95% CI -48.8, -23.6 g/L) greater decrement in hemoglobin (p<0.001) as compared to paint-removal poisoning.

Hence naturally occurring anti-oxidant rich-herbs play a vital role in combating these conditions. The present study was carried out to investigate the in vitro free-radical quenching capacity of a known Ayurvedic poly-herbal formulation called Vayasthapana Rasayana. METHODS: Methanol extracts of Vayasthapana Rasayana formulation (VRF) were studied for in vitro total antioxidant activity along with phenolic content and reducing power. In vitro assays like DPPH, FRAP, ABTS scavenging to evaluate radical quenching potential were performed. RESULTS: The formulation has shown 94% at 0.1 mg/ml DPPH free-radical scavenging activity as against 84% at 0.1 mg/ml for standard ascorbic acid (ICâ‚…â‚€ value 5.51 Î¼g/ml for VRF and 39 Î¼g/ml for standard). It has a significant higher ferric reducing potential also (OD 0.87 at 700 nm & 0.21 at 0.1 mg/ml for VRF and standard, respectively). The total phenolic content (gallic acid equivalent) of the VRF is 8.3 mg per g of dry mass. Total antioxidant capacity of the formulation, estimated by FRAP was 1150 Â± 5 Î¼M Fe(II)/g dry mass. ABTS radical scavenging activity of VRF was 69.55 Â± 0.21% at 100 Î¼g/ml concentration with a IC50 value of 69.87 Î¼g/ml as against 9% and 95% by ascorbic acid and Trolox (at 70.452 Î¼g/ml and 0.250 Î¼g/ml concentrations, respectively). CONCLUSION: In Indian traditional Ayurvedic system, use of VRF is in regular practice for mainly combating age-related disorders and diseases as many of the components of the Rasayana are known for their free-radical scavenging activity.

Present study explores the ameliorative effect of withanolide A, a major component of withania root extract and its molecular mechanism against hypoxia induced memory impairment. Withanolide A was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats before a period of 21 days pre-exposure and during 07 days of exposure to a simulated altitude of 25,000 ft. Glutathione level and glutathione dependent free radicals scavenging enzyme system, ATP, NADPH level, Î³-glutamylcysteinyl ligase (GCLC) activity and oxidative stress markers were assessed in the hippocampus. Expression of apoptotic marker caspase 3 in hippocampus was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Transcriptional alteration and expression of GCLC and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were investigated by real time PCR and immunoblotting respectively. Exposure to hypobaric hypoxia decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) level and impaired reduced gluatathione dependent free radical scavenging system in hippocampus resulting in elevated oxidative stress. Supplementation of withanolide A during hypoxic exposure increased GSH level, augmented GSH dependent free radicals scavenging system and decreased the number of caspase and hoescht positive cells in hippocampus. While withanolide A reversed hypoxia mediated neurodegeneration, administration of buthionine sulfoximine along with withanolide A blunted its neuroprotective effects. Exogenous administration of corticosterone suppressed Nrf2 and GCLC expression whereas inhibition of corticosterone synthesis upregulated Nrf2 as well as GCLC. Thus present study infers that withanolide A reduces neurodegeneration by restoring hypoxia induced glutathione depletion in hippocampus. Further, Withanolide A increases glutathione biosynthesis in neuronal cells by upregulating GCLC level through Nrf2 pathway in a corticosterone dependenet manner.','2014','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','e105311','10','9','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310001','','');

This investigation is to focus the identification of the compound based on biological marker differentiation of four botanical claimants of Shankhpushpi for their antioxidant evaluation on thin layer chromatography (TLC) by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method. A rapid TLC-DPPH method was developed to identify and differentiate four botanical claimants of Shankhpushpi in terms of presence of Î²-carotene, rutin, scopoletin, chlorogenic acid, and mangiferin. C. pluricaulis shows presence of scopoletin; E. alsinoides shows presence of Î²-carotene, scopoletin, and chlorogenic acid; C. ternatea shows presence of Î²-carotene, scopoletin, and rutin; and C. decussata shows presence of Î²-carotene, scopoletin, and mangiferin. The order, they followed, based on their antioxidant potential is Î²-carotene < mangiferin < rutin < scopoletin < chlorogenic acid. Antioxidants are attributed for their beneficial role in age-related cognition decline. The proposed method provides an edge in terms of identification and quantification of antioxidant constituents in a multi-component system.

It is possible that the effectiveness of the therapy may be a result of targeted delivery of active compounds to the brain transcranially. Evidence also comes from two previous studies with positive results on brain targeted transcranial delivery of methadone base and diazepam on rat models. Possibility of transcranial drug delivery was investigated in healthy human volunteers using electroencephalography techniques by assessing the ability of transcranially administered diazepam in bringing about Î² activity in the electroencephalographic wave patterns and shortening of the sleep latency period. Non polar drug molecules dissolved in a non-aqueous sesame oil based vehicle is a significant feature in the transcranial dosage design. The study was under taken in two phases. In the Phase-I study scalp application of a single dose of 2 mg/3 ml of the oil was employed and in the Phase-II study repeat application of three doses 24 h apart were employed. Sleep latency changes were monitored with Multiple Sleep Latency Tests with 5 naps employing the standard electroencephalography, electroocculography and electromyography electrodes. Sleep onset was identified with the first epoch of any sleep stage non rapid eye movement 1, 2, 3, 4 or rapid eye movement using electroencephalography, electroocculography and electromyography criteria. In both phases of the study there was significant reduction in the sleep latencies. It was much more pronounced in the Phase-II study. None of the subjects however displayed beta activity in the electroencephalography. Sleep latency reduction following scalp application in both the phases are suggestive of transcranial migration of diazepam molecules to the receptor sites of the nerve tissue of the brain eliciting its pharmacological effect of sedation. Transcranial brain targeted dosage design is therefore feasible.','Sep-11','12/14/2014 19:27','12/14/2014 19:27','497-503','5','73','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22923861','','');

Bacopa monnieri (brahmi), an Ayurvedic herb, and donepezil, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, have been used to reverse cognitive dysfunctions in several neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of in vitro incubation of lymphocytes from spleens of young (3-month-old), early middle-aged (8- to 9-month-old), and old (18-month-old) F344 rats with brahmi (0.001%, 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.1%, and 1%) and donepezil (5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 Î¼g/ml) on Concanavalin (Con A)-induced proliferation of T lymphocytes and cytokine production, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)]. In addition, the effects of these compounds on the expression of intracellular signaling pathway markers (ERK, p-ERK, CREB, p-CREB, Akt and p-Akt), nitric oxide (NO) production, and the extent of lipid peroxidation were measured in the splenocytes. Age-related decline in Con A-induced proliferation of T lymphocytes was not reversed by treatment with brahmi and donepezil but donepezil alone further reduced the lymphocyte proliferation in young rats. Lower doses of brahmi treatment reversed the age-related decrease in Con A-induced IL-2 and IFN-Î³ production by the splenocytes while their production by splenocytes was suppressed by treatment with donepezil in the young and early middle-aged rats. An age-associated decline in the activities of SOD, CAT, GPx, and GST was evident in the lymphocytes of spleen. Brahmi enhanced CAT activity of lymphocytes in all the age groups while donepezil increased SOD activity in old rats. Both brahmi and donepezil increased GPx and GST activities in a dose-dependent manner in the lymphocytes of all age groups. There was an age-related decline in NO production and increase in the extent of lipid peroxidation in the splenocytes. Brahmi and donepezil increased NO production in the lymphocytes of early middle-aged and old rats. Brahmi reversed the age-related increase in lipid peroxidation in the splenocytes of both early-middle-aged and old rats while donepezil suppressed lipid peroxidation only in the splenocytes of old rats. The expressions of p-ERK1/2 and p-CREB in the splenocytes were elevated following treatment with brahmi and donepezil in the early middle-aged and old rats while age-related decline in p-Akt expression was reversed by treatment of lymphocytes with brahmi alone in early-middle-aged and old rats. Taken together, these results suggest that both brahmi and donepezil exert distinct age-related effects on the cell-mediated immune responses through selective modulation of antioxidant enzyme activities and intracellular targets that may influence the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs in neurodegenerative diseases.','Feb-13','12/14/2014 19:14','12/14/2014 19:14','260-274','2','15','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23257614','','Aging; Animals; Bacopa; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Cytokines; Enzyme Activation; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Immunity, Cellular; Indans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Nervous System Diseases; Oxidative Stress; Piperidines; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Signal Transduction; Spleen; T-Lymphocytes');

Cancer has been known since ancient times and has been mentioned in the ancient Ayurvedic books. Thus natural based products play a significant role in cancer chemotherapeutics. Further, approximately 70% of anticancer compounds are based on natural products or have been derived from their structural scaffolds. Hence there is a growing interest for developing medicines from these natural resources. Amongst the methods of treating cancer, therapies targeting cancer stem cell are found to control metastatic tumor which is a newly identified factor associated with relapse. This patent review aims to highlight the use of natural products to treat cancer by targeting the cancer stem cells. The review will also provide insights into the reported mechanisms by which the natural products act in order to suppress or kill cancer stem cells. The analysis has been done using various criterions like the patenting trend over the years, comparison of active assignee and comparison of the technology used in different patents. The analysis further highlights different bioactives, the scaffolds of which could thus be a promising candidate in the development of anti-cancer drugs by targeting the cancer stem cells. The technical aspects covered in this review include: Bioactives and formulations comprising the extracts or bioactives, their mode of action and the type of assay considered to study the efficacy of the natural products. Further the mapping has helped us to identify potential therapeutic areas to evaluate herbs/bioactives and their uses for developing new formulations.','19-Aug-14','12/14/2014 18:39','12/14/2014 18:39','','','','ENG','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25138131','','');

We report, here, the activity of different extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water) of Quercus infectoria galls against dental pathogens -- Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus acidophilus (designated) and Streptococcus sanguis (isolated). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cup-plate method was used in anti-bacterial activity of the extracts at concentration of 200 mg/ml against dental pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of most effective extracts against the most susceptible bacteria were determined using a two-fold serial micro dilution method. RESULTS: Methanolic extract showed maximum anti-bacterial activity against all the bacteria. The most susceptible bacteria were S. sanguis followed by S. aureus, S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus. The MIC values showed that methanolic extract was more effective than water extract. CONCLUSION: The plant has the potential to generate herbal metabolites. The crude extracts demonstrating anti-dental caries activity could result in the discovery of new chemical classes of antibiotics. These chemical classes of antibiotics could serve as selective agents for the maintenance of human health and provide bio-chemical tools for the study of infectious diseases.','2009 Jul-Sep','12/15/2014 3:03','12/15/2014 3:03','337-339','3','20','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19884719','','Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Lactobacillus; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Mouth; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Plant Tumors; Quercus; Staphylococcus; Streptococcus');

Amongst these are plants used for the management of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\'s, Alzheimer\'s, loss of memory, degeneration of nerves and other neuronal disorders by the Ayurvedic practitioners. Though the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases remains enigmatic, there is evidence, which indicates that defective energy metabolism, excitotoxicity and oxidative damage may be crucial factors (Ann. Neurol. 38 (3) (1995) 357). The part of the Ayurvedic system that provides an approach to prevention and treatment of degenerative diseases is known as Rasayana, and plants used for this purpose are classed as rejuvenators. This group of plants generally possesses strong antioxidant activity (Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 43 (1992) 1175), but only a few have been investigated in detail. In the present study, three such rasayana plants were tested for the first time for their toxicity and free radical scavenging activity both in vitro and ex vivo. All the three plant infusions (up to 1 mg/ml) showed no toxic effects on the viability of PC12 cell line as judged by MTT-test. Both ethanolic extracts and water infusions of the plants were tested for their antioxidant activity in the 2,2\'-azinobis-3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS*(+)) radical cation decolorization assay; inhibition of lipid peroxidation by plant infusions was carried out using spontaneous lipid peroxidation of rat brain homogenate, and IC50 values were determined. The results from the ABTS assay showed that the ethanolic extract of Sida cordifolia was found to be most potent (IC50 16.07 microg/ml), followed by Evolvulus alsinoides (IC50 33.39 microg/ml) and Cynodon dactylon (IC50 78.62 microg/ml).

Randomized, controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy and short-term safety of these therapies. PURPOSE: To review randomized, controlled trials of CAM therapies for menopausal symptoms in order to better inform practice and guide future research. DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE for articles published from January 1966 through March 2002, of the Alternative and Complementary Database (AMED) of the British Library for articles published from January 1985 through December 2000, and of the authors\' own extensive files. Search terms were hot flash/flush, menopause, and climacteric, combined with phytoestrogens, alternative medicine, herbal medicine, traditional medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM ), Ayurveda, naturopathy, chiropractic, osteopathy, massage, yoga, relaxation therapy, homeopathy, aromatherapy, and therapeutic touch. STUDY SELECTION: 29 randomized, controlled clinical trials of CAM therapies for hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms were identified; of these, 12 dealt with soy or soy extracts, 10 with herbs, and 7 with other CAM therapies. DATA EXTRACTION: Each author extracted information from half of the studies on the number of patients, study design, outcome measures, and results; the other author then checked these results. DATA SYNTHESIS: Soy seems to have modest benefit for hot flashes, but studies are not conclusive. Isoflavone preparations seem to be less effective than soy foods. Black cohosh may be effective for menopausal symptoms, especially hot flashes, but the lack of adequate long-term safety data (mainly on estrogenic stimulation of the breast or endometrium) precludes recommending long-term use. Single clinical trials have found that dong quai, evening primrose oil, a Chinese herb mixture, vitamin E, and acupuncture do not affect hot flashes; two trials have shown that red clover has no benefit for treating hot flashes. CONCLUSIONS: Black cohosh and foods that contain phytoestrogens show promise for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Clinical trials do not support the use of other herbs or CAM therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The stabilization potential was studied on mouse peritoneal mast cells and the antihistaminic activity was carried out by determining the mortality rate of mice treated with toxicant (compound 48/80) and the effect on elevation of histamine release upon degranulation. RESULTS: The increased number of intact mast cells (43.640 Â± 1.7% and 61.57 Â± 1.79% at 200 and 400â€‰mg/ kg, respectively) suggested that the BMLC stabilized the mast cell degranulation and showed decreased elevation of histamine.

The proposed method utilizes a Cosmosil C(8) column (250 Î„ 4.6 mm) with a compatible Phenomenex C(8) guard column with isocratic elution of acetonitrile and water (95:5 v/v) at 25Â°. An effluent flow rate of 2 ml/min and UV detection at 202 nm was used for the analysis of phytosterols. The described method was linear in the range of 1-500 Î¼g/ml, with excellent correlation coefficients. The precision, robustness and ruggedness values were also within the prescribed limits (less than 2%). The recovery values were within the range, which indicates that the accuracy of the analysis was good and that the interference of the matrix with the recovery of phytosterols was low. The phytosterols were found to be stable in a stock solution for 48 h (% RSD was below 2%) and no interfering extra peaks were observed under controlled stress conditions.

Patients who attended the stone clinic for the first time were interviewed to find out what drugs they had been taking before the attendance at the stone clinic. 350 patients consuming specific drugs relevant to stone formation at least for a period of 15 days were selected for a detailed assessment. The type of drug consumed, the dose, the duration, the side effects, compliance rate and effect on stone disease were assessed. The biochemical profile of the patients was assessed to identify the role of the therapeutic modalities utilised. Conclusions regarding the utility of drugs in the process of stone formation were made. The values were compared with those of patients not on medication and considering laboratory standards. Of the 350 patients studied, 96 patients were consuming potassium citrate in different doses, 50 were consuming allopurinol, 44 cystone, 27 potassium citrate + magnesium, 25 calcury, 24 rowatinex, 21 ayurvedic drugs, 17 dystone, 17 homeopathic medicines and 17 other drugs. The longest duration of compliance was for cystone-2.5 years. All other drugs were stopped by the patients themselves due to recurrence of symptoms. As much as 93% of the patients did not feel that there was any significant relief of symptoms. The side effects which prompted the patients to stop medicine were gastro intestinal upset, particularly with potassium citrate, rowatinex and potassium citrate + magnesium combination. The relevant biochemical changes noted were increased urinary citrate levels in patients consuming potassium citrate alone or in combination with magnesium. Serum uric acid was within normal limits in patients consuming allopurinol. Urine uric acid levels were also lower in patients on allopurinol.

From this it appears that Ayurveda\'s more holistic approach is no longer in opposition to the views of physics and biology. In physics, experimental verification of phenomena associated with quantum correlations have forced scientists to accept that the macroscopic world is not strongly objective: traditional western scientific ontology stands rejected. One consequence is that the world is not necessarily reductionist i.e. based solely on the properties of its tiniest constituents. In biology, the 1930\'s discovery of homeostasis has reached a natural climax: the feedback instabilities, identified by Norbert Wiener as inevitably accompanying control processes, are now recognized to be states of optimal regulation, where organisms centre their function. The non-reductive properties of these states clearly distinguish the theory of control from previous physical theories; they now occupy the centre-stage of life. Possibly against expectation, their non-reductive nature makes their physics holistic: western biology seems to have broken free of reductionist physics. When Ayurveda and bioscience are compared in light of these little appreciated advances in fundamental science, the supposed differences between them are vastly reduced - they practically dissolve. Instead of being poles apart, the ontologies of western science and Ayurveda seem to have become almost identical.','Jul-12','12/14/2014 19:27','12/14/2014 19:27','119-123','3','3','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23125507','','');

Ayurvedic practitioners and their patients believe that the toxic properties of the metals are reduced or eliminated during preparation and processing. CASE REPORT: A 69Â year old Caucasian male retired professional with a prior history of stroke presented for evaluation of new onset depression, fatigue, generalized weakness, constipation, anorexia, and weight loss. History revealed that his symptoms were temporally related to initiation of an Ayurvedic herbal medication. The patient had been previously admitted to another hospital for these symptoms and was found to have a severe anemia for which no etiology was found. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated blood lead level and a diagnosis of symptomatic lead toxicity was made. The patient was treated with intramuscular, intravenous, and oral chelation therapy to promote lead excretion. Because of complaints of continued poor mental function, neuropsychological tests were administered before and after one of the chelation treatments and showed improvement in measures of attention and other cognitive domains. In addition, the patient was able to discontinue use of antidepressant medication after chelation. DISCUSSION: A high index of suspicion of metal toxicity is necessary among persons with characteristic symptoms and signs in the absence of occupational exposure. Despite limited evidence for chelation in adults and in those with modest blood lead levels, this patient appeared to benefit from repeated chelation therapy. Both allopathic and alternative medicine practitioners and public health specialists need to be aware of the potential for contamination of and side effects from alternative pharmacologic and herbal therapies.','2013','12/14/2014 18:55','12/14/2014 18:55','26','1','8','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24083830','','');

The approach of Agni karma has been mentioned in the context of diseases like Arsha, Arbuda, Bhagandar, Sira, Snayu, Asthi, Sandhigata Vata Vikaras and Gridhrasi. Gridhrasi is seen as a panic condition in the society as it is one of the burning problems, especially in the life of daily laborers. It is characterized by distinct pain starting from Sphik Pradesha (gluteal region) and goes down toward the Parshni Pratyanguli (foot region) of the affected side of leg. On the basis of symptomatology, Gridhrasi may be simulated with the disease sciatica in modern parlance. In modern medicine, the disease sciatica is managed only with potent analgesics or some sort of surgical interventions which have their own limitations and adverse effects, whereas in Ayurveda, various treatment modalities like Siravedha, Agni karma, Basti Chikitsa and palliative medicines are used successfully. Among these, Agni karma procedure seems to be more effective by providing timely relief. Shalakas for Agni karma, made up of different Dhatus like gold, silver, copper, iron, etc. for different stages of the disease conditions, have been proposed. In the present work, a comparative study of Agni karma by using iron, copper and previously studied Panchadhatu Shalaka in Gridhrashi has been conducted. A total of 22 patients were treated in three groups. Result of the entire study showed that Agni karma by Panchadhatu Shalaka provided better result in combating the symptoms, especially Ruka and Tandra, while Lauhadhatu Shalaka gave better results in combating symptoms of Spanadana and Gaurava. In the meantime, Tamradhatu Shalaka provided better effect in controlling symptoms like Toda, Stambha and Aruchi. Fifty percent patients in Panchadhatu Shalaka (Group A) were completely relieved. In Lauhadhatu Shalaka (Group B), the success rate was 00.00%, and in Tamradhatu Shalaka (Group C), the percentage of success rate was 14.28%. After analyzing the data, Tamradhatu Shalaka was found to be more effective than Lauha and Panchadhatu Shalakas.','Apr-10','12/15/2014 3:03','12/15/2014 3:03','240-244','2','31','eng','NCBI PubMed','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22131718','','');
